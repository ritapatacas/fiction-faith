  "abyss": "Justice is fierce, but fair. She holds the scales of positive and negative forces with her eye, constantly scrutinizing and weighing our decisions. Yet still she stands, staring straight into our eyes, looking deep into our soul. Justice can see the most hidden of our intentions; she can sense if our choices and actions are based on truth or deception. In a sense, she represents our inner voice of reason and conscience. She knows no grey area; her judgment is stark and absolute. However, remember that unlike us, she can see the bigger picture. You only have one chance to present your case before her, so make it count and don't try to trick her keen eye. When Justice appears know that all will be revealed, for better or worse. Everything hidden will make its way to the surface in true revelation. This card can indicate legal proceedings or lawsuits. One way or another the truth must come out. If you have been wronged or if you have wronged someone else, justice will prevail. All will be judged for their actions, so act responsibly and be honest with yourself and others. Perhaps there are some big decisions that need to be made at this time. If so, the Justice card can also indicate the need to consider those choices carefully. Balance is key in all things. Hence, remove anything that is in excess or difficult. Useless things must be put away in order to restore equilibrium."
