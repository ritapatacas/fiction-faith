    "career_meaning": "The queen of wands, when reversed, shows a lack of professional enthusiasm. You might be drained or unwilling to take on new tasks. This negativity towards work can affect both your outlook on your performance in your work life. While your career is only part of your life, it is important to feel satisfied with the work you do.

Thus, you should make an effort to remember what motivated you to find this job, the aspects about it that you like, and any other positive attributes you can prescribe to it.

  "abyss": "The Queen of Wands sits meditatively in front of a growing fire. Having received the fuel from the Page of Wands and the Fire Elemental from the Knight of Wands, she bears the all-important task of igniting the fire. While the Court Cards before her provided the raw materials for the fire, her function is to bring the fire into being. As a Queen should, she tends to the fire with great care and ability, seeing that it remains lit, sharing its vital warmth and light with all. The Queen of Wands in a reading indicates a warm, outgoing individual in your life. She is one who is dedicated, and will give her total attention to any task she undertakes. It is her ability to focus her energy inward that allows her to harness the creative energy of the Suit of Wands. Like any Queen, she is confident in her abilities and optimistic in nature."
