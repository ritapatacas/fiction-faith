  "description": "The Nine of Pentacles depicts a woman in the middle of a vineyard. The woman wears what appears to be a long, luxurious dress adorned with sunflowers. She seems to be part of a wealthy house, for in the far background, we see a castle. A falcon is sitting peacefully and playfully on her left hand. The vines behind her are rich and filled with grapes and golden coins, signaling that she has been very successful in her ventures, which are yielding a great and plentiful harvest.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "This Nine of Pentacles card indicates that the querent has reached a stage in their lives where they are confident, independent and self-sufficient. Through hard work, this person is now ready to enjoy money, leisure and material comfort.\nThe difficulties that were faced in the earlier journey of the pentacles appear to be over. The Nine of Pentacles conveys not only joy, but also the feeling of security and freedom that material wealth can bring. Looking back, the querent can now celebrate the difficulties, the struggles, and the hard work that lined her path. Her previous challenges gave her the wider perspective she needs to understand the spiritual value of her success. Knowing how difficult it was to get here, she intends to enjoy every single day that is given to her.\n\nThe Nine of Pentacles conveys not only joy, but also the feeling of security and freedom that material wealth can bring.\n\nLike the other nines in the tarot, sometimes this card indicates that the querent has not yet reached completion in their journey. There is something that is missing here - the element of her community and relationships. The gifts of the suits are meant to be shared, and yet this woman is so far from home.\nThe Nine of Pentacles can also be about a specific time period of this person’s life. This time is about restraint and grace. Diplomacy and grace will lead to the desired outcome.",
    "love_meaning": "Life has been kind to you; and you may at the moment be experiencing a time of luxury, or at least, having everything that you need. Even if you’re not partnered right now, romance doesn’t seem particularly pressing to you. You may just be seeking to appreciate what you have. This quality can make you even more attractive to others; lovers found now will need to make sure that they contribute to that happiness, not take away from it. Those who are already in a relationship may find that each person has their own achievements, careers, hobbies, interests and social life; there is a healthy mix of independence and love amongst you two. Sometimes, this card can also point towards you and your lover working on your home together, and creating a space that is truly yours.",

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "The Nine of Pentacles reversed can be indicative of suffering from financial issues. It can perhaps indicate a false display of security and stability. There may be a desire here to keep up appearances - to have all the finer things in life even when we cannot afford to do so. Where does this stem from?\n\nThere may be a desire here to keep up appearances - to have all the finer things in life even when we cannot afford to do so.\n\nTake this as an opportunity for you to figure out what it is most important. The Nine of Pentacles reversed indicates a moment when one truly sees - perhaps for the first time, that we cannot depend completely on material wealth to bring happiness.\n\nOther meanings of this card differ with context - you may instead find yourself at a period in life where you should be able to rest and relax after years of hard work, but you find yourself unable to unwind. In this case, rejuvenation is the ultimate advice of the Nine of Pentacles reversed. You need to take a few steps back and allow yourself to rest and regain your strength.",
    "love_meaning": "While it may look like you have it all right now, the reality may not be the case. The reversed 9 of Pentacles tarot love meaning can signal a feeling that despite having everything, your life is still missing something. Those who are single may be well aware of this; you may have a good career, stable finances, good friendships and relationships with family, but love still evades you. Sometimes, this can be unconscious; you may be worried about giving up your independence, or perhaps afraid of sharing your life with someone who will not love you for who you are, but what you have. You may not even realize that you are pushing others away. If you’re in a relationship, you may still feel guarded, despite your best efforts and desires to spend your life with this person. The reversed 9 of Pentacles asks you to open up; and address what you are fearing, so you can experience love without fear.",
    "career_meaning": "If you’ve dealt with any failures lately, it may be because you haven’t put in too much effort. The 9 of Pentacles can suggest that you desperately desire success, but may not be ready to actually work for it. On the other hand, this card can indicate that you may have worked so hard that everything else has fallen by the wayside. Time passes quickly, and before you know it, everything can change. Take some time to review your finances, if you have a business. You need to make sure that the people that you work with are trustworthy. Take time to check your legal documents to be safe as well.",
    "finances_meaning": "You may be overspending right now, and you may have to deal with some serious financial recklessness. Impulse buys and spending beyond your means can lead to regrets. You may also be financially dependent on another person. This card is also a warning to avoid engaging with shady business deals, or get rich quick schemes. These can often lead you to financial ruin.",
    "as_feelings": "The arrival of the reversed Nine of Pentacles suggests that this person may be feeling insecure or inadequate. They might perceive a lack of independence or self-sufficiency in themselves, leading them to question their worthiness in your eyes. Their feelings could be clouded by jealousy or a fear of not measuring up, making it difficult for them to fully embrace the connection between you.\nIn terms of your own feelings, this card indicates that you might be grappling with similar insecurities. You could feel unfulfilled despite external appearances and find yourself longing for deeper emotional satisfaction. This sense of discontent may prompt you to reflect on what truly brings joy and fulfillment into your life, urging you to seek out genuine connections rather than superficial validations.",
    "as_actions": "The arrival of the reversed Nine of Pentacles suggests that you should reassess your relationship with independence and self-sufficiency. It may be time to recognize areas where you have become overly reliant on material success or external validation. Shift your focus inward; prioritize personal growth over appearances. Consider engaging in activities that nurture your spirit, such as journaling or practicing mindfulness. Reconnect with nature by taking walks or tending to a garden, allowing yourself to appreciate simple pleasures without the pressure of achievement. Embrace collaboration rather than isolation; seek out supportive communities that encourage shared experiences and mutual growth.",

  "abyss": "A silver-haired woman of dignity and grace stands surrounded by life and plenty in her garden. She cradles a delicate finch in her hands, a Native American symbol of joy and happiness. On her head she wears a silver band of nine pentacles. The peace and equanimity she radiates indicates that she is someone who has achieved her goals in life. The warm smile on her lips shows that she is not afraid of what tomorrow will bring. The Nine of Pentacles speaks of self-reliance and goals achieved. Most often, we gain this confidence and success with age. The woman in the card has earned the right to be exactly who she chooses to be. She may or may not be wealthy, but it doesn't matter either way. Hers is not so much a material wealth as a spiritual one. Her goals accomplished, she can now focus on more personal, spiritual pursuits. You too can be like her—discover the simple joy in what you have achieved, and the fact that you don't have to worry at this time."
