  "description": "The Five of Wands depicts five men all holding their own wands and brandishing them up in the air. Like with most fives in the tarot, it is about some kind of disagreement that is facing the querent. This disagreement can either be taken to be as a sign of conflict between the men, or that all of them are simply enjoying the adrenaline rush of this conflict, and that the competition amongst them is of a good natured rivalry, not anger. The relaxed way in which they seem to be holding their wands gives a sense that this argument may be one of show rather than a fierce one.",

    "overview": "From the image on the card, the symbolism in the Five of Wands suggests that there is form of conflict in one’s life. This may be an existing conflict or one that is brewing and may eventually blow up in one's face. It may also depict a problem in communication, for example in a situation where no one really wants to listen to the other - meaning that no agreement or understanding takes place. The five men may signify problems in a group of people who are not patient enough to listen to what anyone else is saying. They only want to be heard, and since none of the others will listen, they all argue at once.\n\nMuch of this can be solved by the querent taking the first step to try and initiate communication in such a way that you suggest that everyone airs out what they have to say, one at a time. By doing this, you will be able to address the problem, and everyone will be heard. Meaning they’ll all be satisfied.\nThe Five of Wands can also mean that you are or will be facing competition in an area that you are not used to. This can be at work or school where you will meet people with the same abilities as you who pose quite a challenge - leading to feelings of jealousy, greed, and envy. This tarot card encourages that you accept the competition as a way for you to improve yourself without feeling any malice towards them. This means that you should learn how to cope with them in a civil way.\n\nThis tarot card encourages that you accept the competition as a way for you to improve yourself without feeling any malice towards them.\n\nThe Five of Wands meaning could also be a personal struggle that you are dealing with on your own.

Should you already be in a relationship, there may be some small conflicts. Beware that what initially starts off as playful banter can turn into explosive arguments when either of you are stressed.

  "abyss": "Have you ever seen two birds fighting? Their wings flap wildly and violently as they fall through the air. They look as though they’re going to come crashing to earth, but at the last minute, they spread their wings and take flight again. Similarly, the Five of Wands is the card of competition and strife. It most often predicts that some sort of disagreement is about to enter your life. It can also indicate a competition of some sort. If it is the latter, the Five of Wands will stir something inside of you, a need to rise to the challenge and prove yourself worthy of the prize. It will drive and motivate you to push through. As this card is still part of the Suit of Wands, the disagreements it signifies are typically external arguments, as opposed to internal conflicts that might be indicated by the Suit of Cups. Regardless of the specific form of conflict that it represents, know it will be one that will certainly stir you in some way."
