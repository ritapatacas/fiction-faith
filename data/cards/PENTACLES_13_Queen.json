Avoid getting into relationships for the wrong reasons; whether it’s for status, money or simply because you don’t want to be alone.

  "abyss": "The Knight of Pentacles has dutifully delivered the magic key to his queen, who has used it to unlock a mystical treasure of tremendous import. No one except the nurturing Queen of Pentacles would have known where to find it. She carefully removes the earth and unlocks the wooden box. Then with care and reverence she takes out the Heart of Pentacles, rooted within the earth and forged through patience and perseverance of time. As its name clearly implies, the pentacle is a coin with an image of the five-pointed star, or pentagram, which is an ancient symbol of life. The lower four points represent the elements of earth, water, air and fire. The top-most point symbolizes the intellect or reason. When the star is right side up, as it is pictured here, it indicates that reason has dominion over the physical, emotional, mental and inspirational urges. It is indicative of the life perfectly lived. This is why it was a mystical secret so great that only the queen could unlock it, and which only the king, with the support of his court, can properly wield. In order to live most fully, we must master our lower urges, and direct them all lovingly and carefully under the guidance of Spirit. When the Queen of Pentacles appears in your reading, it can represent a person in your life who is nurturing and down-to-earth. This person, often but not always a woman, will have a big heart and is very welcoming, always greeting others with a warm smile. She is the archetypal mother who can make anyone feel at home. If she appears in your reading, ask yourself if you are presently embodying her qualities, or if perhaps you need a bit more of her nature in your life. Are you bringing in comfort and warmth? Are you caring for and looking after those in your life fully? She brings a soft, almost forgotten energy that we all the more crave for its rareness. Mind you, however, that while she may be caring and kind, she is far from a fool. She is a queen, and has all the manner and dignity befitting her office. She is also a resourceful and grounded person, independent and confident in her nature, and she can confer those qualities to you."
