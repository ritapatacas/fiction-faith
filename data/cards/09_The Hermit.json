  "description": "The Hermit depicts an old man standing alone at the peak of the mountain while holding a lantern in one of his hands and a staff on the other. The mountain denotes accomplishment, development, and success. The hermit tarot card refers to the level of spiritual knowledge that he attained, and that he is ready to impart that knowledge to everyone. There is also a deep commitment he has to his goal and a solid awareness of the path that he is taking. Inside the lantern, you will notice a star with 6 points which is also known as the Seal of Solomon. This symbol represents wisdom. The staff that he holds depicts authority and power.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "The Hermit is a seeker for the knowledge that comes from within. A lonely wanderer in the path of the night, he searches for that which can only be gained with long periods of solitude - the inner voice. To hear it, he must disconnect from the crowds whose voices and desires threaten to overcome his own. He walks through the dark night of his unconscious, guided only by the low light of the northern star, with his destination being his home, his self.\n\nHe walks through the dark night of his unconscious, guided only by the low light of the northern star, with his destination being his home, his self.\n\nYou are currently contemplating that you need to be alone. Never be afraid to take this chance to reflect, as it could help you clear your mind of all the clutter that comes with everyday life. The Hermit may also refer to your effort in taking action that is authentic and aligned with your true self. You are perhaps searching your inner soul for guidance on what is right, and where your next steps are to be.\nThe hermit's appearance in a reading can also denote the appearance of someone who will come to your life that will be your mentor.",
    "love_meaning": "Love, being one of life’s greatest mysteries, can be a great teacher. It requires all of us to truly know ourselves, our needs, our fears and our insecurities. The Hermit tarot love meaning can signal that we may need some time alone in order to develop some insight about our selves before forming a strong romantic relationship with another person. This period may feel a bit lonely, but it will place you on the right path to finding a love that you are meant to have. If you’re already in a relationship, this soul-searching is something that the two of you may want to do together. Both of you may want to think about what you expect out of a relationship, and what may make you happier. The initial talks may be uncomfortable, but will prepare a strong foundation for tackling the future ahead.",
    "career_meaning": "You may be spending some much needed time thinking about what you want out of your career right now. You may feel as though the path you are treading at the moment is not really working for you, and there can be the sense of not being fulfilled. Right now, you are trying to understand what kind of work would give you joy on all levels. If you’ve been pursuing a career purely for money, or financial stability, these qualifications are no longer enough for you. You may be looking for a purpose, or at least something that gets you closer to who you want to be.",
    "finances_meaning": "You may be coming to the realization that money doesn’t bring you happiness right now. This may be a time with less focus on material things, and more focus on trying to understand where you can truly find fulfillment.",
    "as_feelings": "The Hermit signals a deep dive into someone’s feelings about you. This person is taking time to reflect on their emotions and the bond between you. They feel drawn to solitude, seeking clarity in their thoughts, indicating that their feelings are thoughtful and profound, not rushed. While they appreciate your presence, they may be wrestling with uncertainties or personal issues that require them to step back for now.\nYour own feelings call for introspection as The Hermit encourages self-discovery. You might find yourself searching within for answers, contemplating what truly matters in this relationship. There’s a desire for deeper understanding of your emotional landscape, prompting you to explore what fulfillment means at this moment. Embrace this period of reflection; it can lead to greater insight into both yourself and the dynamics at play with this person.",
    "as_actions": "When you draw The Hermit, it’s a powerful reminder to embrace solitude and reflection. You should seek a quiet space to reflect on your inner thoughts and feelings, allowing yourself to disconnect from external distractions. This could mean taking a day off from social media or spending time in nature, where you can contemplate your life’s direction. Embrace this period of self-discovery by journaling your insights or meditating daily. By turning inward, you will gain clarity about what truly matters to you, helping illuminate the path forward with renewed purpose and understanding. Trust that this journey within will guide your next steps wisely.",
    "love": "pause in love life to introspect, self-understanding in love",
    "career": "contemplating next steps in career, searching for purpose in career",
    "finances": "contemplating role of finances in happiness, less focus on material things"

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "When reversed, you are perhaps in a situation where you'd like to be alone; there is nothing wrong about that. However, there is a possibility that your seclusion may become harmful to both yourself and others. Though the Hermit sets forwards with noble intentions to search for his inner truth, his path inward may also be filled with great danger. Going inward may lead to madness and the abyss, for the unconscious is filled with images that he may not yet understand, lurking and waiting to lure you ever inside. Like a man that gets lost in his own dreams, the hermit may find himself stuck in a world of his own, alone, trapped, unreal. You must learn to balance your need for truth with connection to your fellow human.\n\nWhen it comes to work, the hermit reversal meaning refers to your preparedness to get to the bottom of something that has been troubling you for quite some time now. There is searching to be done, and it will be your responsibility to ask the question that will allow the other people to understand the circumstances.",
    "love_meaning": "The reversed Hermit tarot love meaning can indicate a period of loneliness, one that is being forced on you instead of one that you are initiating yourself. While this time may be trying, making the most of it can help you concentrate on your own goals, and clarify what it is you want from a partner and from life. These will be the building blocks for creating a strong future relationship. Should you already be in a relationship, you may find that one of you feels distant and is drifting away. Someone may feel alone in the partnership, despite each person’s efforts. Now is the time to examine these dynamics and see whether you can extend a hand. Attention, care and a strong dose of self-awareness may be needed in order to feel connected again.",
    "career_meaning": "At times, the reversed Hermit can signal coming out of a period of contemplation. You may be ready to rejoin society, this time with a clearer understanding of what it is you want in terms of your career. You may now need to do a bit of realignment, whether it’s looking for a new job, networking to find mentors and teammates, or other more socially related aspects of developing your career. On the other hand, it can also be that your period of solitude can be extending further; you may choose to avoid working with others altogether. Being on your own may feel much less limiting at first; but make sure you continue to receive social support. At times, this card can also indicate being forced to work alone, leading to feelings of loneliness, or being an outcast amongst your coworkers.",
    "finances_meaning": "When it comes to financial decisions, you may be ready to look for advice from outside sources. Ideally you have come out of a period of contemplation on what material security and money means to you, and you may be putting those insights to use. Hopefully, this can lead to a better relationship with your material situation.",
    "as_feelings": "When you draw the reversed Hermit, it signals a deep sense of confusion and isolation in how this person feels about you. They may be struggling with their emotions, feeling disconnected or unsure about what they truly want. This uncertainty can lead to feelings of loneliness or even withdrawal from the relationship, as they grapple with their inner thoughts rather than openly expressing them.\nYou might feel a call to reflect on these dynamics and experience a mix of frustration and concern. The reversed Hermit prompts you to examine whether you're seeking clarity within yourself while also yearning for deeper connection. It encourages you to confront any fears of vulnerability that may be holding both of you back from genuine intimacy and understanding.",
    "as_actions": "When you draw the reversed Hermit, it’s a clear signal that stepping out of isolation is essential. Instead of retreating into solitude, seek new perspectives by engaging in conversations or activities that challenge your current beliefs. Consider joining a local group or class where you can share ideas and learn from others. This action will not only broaden your horizons but also help you find clarity on personal issues you've been contemplating alone. Embrace vulnerability by sharing your thoughts with trusted friends; their insights may illuminate paths you hadn’t considered before.",
    "love": "romantic rejection, loneliness, feeling distant from partner",
    "career": "realigning career to internal goals, outcast at work, working alone",
    "finances": "better understanding of material situation"

  "abyss": "She walks alone into the desert, searching. Her withered face reveals the tests of time she has seen and surmounted. The Hermit has no regrets; she has gained profound knowledge of the material world, yet senses that there is more to reality than simply what is visible. In her right hand she grasps a large snake, a symbol of renewal and rebirth. As the snake sheds its skin as it grows, so shall the Hermit shed her old self and re-emerge wiser and more whole. Her left hand appears to radiate light, illuminating the path, one step at a time. Her journey is a slow one, but she is in no rush. The Hermit has deliberately removed herself from the world in order to subdue the conscious mind. When the Hermit appears in your reading, it augurs a time for soul-searching and introspection. This voyage must be solitary; it cannot be achieved through others. It is a soul journey that requires inward attention. Perhaps you need to take a break from the business of life and focus on reconstituting your inner self. The snake moves slowly and is a grounded animal. Therefore, be like the snake, be sure that regardless of the things going on in your life, particularly if it is a more tumultuous period, that you remain grounded. Do not rush; the Hermit is calling you back to center. You must be still in the midst of the storm so that you may discover balance and the answers you seek."
