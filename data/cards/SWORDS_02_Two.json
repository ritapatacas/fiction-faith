  "description": "The Two of Swords symbolizes the confusion we face when we are forced to make difficult choices. In the Two of Swords card, there is a seated woman that is blindfolded while holding a sword in each of her hands. In the background, there is a sea surrounded by crags and rocks that serve as obstacles for vessels and ships, stalling progress and action. The woman in the card being blindfolded is a representation of a situation which prevents her from seeing both the problem and the solution with clarity.\n\nThe swords that she is holding in each of her hands show that there are two choices that lead in different directions and are mutually exclusive to one another. It may also depict a stalemate, which means that the problem should be addressed with a logical and rational thinking.\nThe Moon\npositioned on the right side of the card signifies may signify the role of illusions and deception in the difficulty that the woman has in making a choice.",

    "overview": "When we see the Two of Swords in a reading, we are encountering a stalemate. Two equal and opposing forces are joined in battle, and there seems to be no end in sight. This wasn't what you had in mind when you chanced to walk down this path, and you find yourself caught in the middle. Without something, or someone to intervene, this may continue indefinitely. We find ourselves in a situation where we must make a choice, we can side with one part of the situation, or we can side with the other. Neither seems particularly appealing, which makes the decision even more difficult. But unless we move past this stalemate, there can be no more progress.\n\nWe find ourselves in a situation where we must make a choice...Neither seems particularly appealing.\n\nThe Two of Swords is often related with balance and partnership. It signifies the need to keep your relationships balanced. Regardless if it is in business, friendship or romantic relationship, you may find yourself struggling to maintain the current state of affairs, and may find yourself caught in the middle. In regards to your work, you may be currently stuck in limbo and are perhaps waiting on another party's decision. Remain patient and avoid pressuring people in making their decision abruptly.\nThe Two of Swords meaning may depict a warning to have caution.

  "abyss": "Traditionally, the Two of Swords is depicted as a blindfolded woman holding two swords crossed in front of her chest. I chose to go a slightly different way artistically, but the card still retains its original meaning. Day in and day out, we present different aspects of ourselves to the world, and even those closest to us. Each of us wears so many masks that sometimes we are in danger of forgetting our own true nature. The woman has no facial features; she has yet to choose what parts of herself she will reveal to the world. The Two of Swords card draws attention to a tense situation, one in which you are unable or simply don't want to make a decision. You are at a stalemate, an impasse of the mind. So, I ask you: which aspect of yourself is creating this impasse at this time? A choice needs to be made, and hiding behind any masks will prolong the discomfort. Sometimes no action is an action and avoiding the truth only delays the inevitable. Is there a situation you're unwilling to accept? Maybe we should try to first distinguish the clear features that we have, the ones that have always been there in order to help us choose."
