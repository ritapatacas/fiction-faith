    "career_meaning": "You have lots of energy and curiosity, but right now it’s not really directed at anything. With no outlet, it seems like you can’t quite make up your mind about what it is you actually want to do for your future. You may move from one job to the next when you get bored, or decide it’s not for you. Oftentimes, to really get the full depth and experience of working somewhere, you do need to commit for a long time. Sometimes, this card can also indicate having lots of big ideas, but zero follow through. Without action, nothing ever comes to fruition. Get working! This card can also point to an office gossip, or a rude individual who uses their words to hurt others.",
    "finances_meaning": "Your ideas about making the most out of your money may not be practical ones, or they may be all talk, without a plan for taking action. It may also be that all the research you put into bettering your finances isn’t really going anywhere. You may feel rather overwhelmed about what you should do next instead of just doing something. What are you overanalyzing?",
    "as_feelings": "The arrival of the reversed Page of Swords suggests that this person is grappling with confusion and uncertainty. They may feel overwhelmed by their thoughts or hesitant to express themselves clearly, leading to mixed signals or misunderstandings. Their feelings are clouded by doubt, making it difficult for them to fully engage with you emotionally.\nWhen it comes to your own feelings, the reversed Page of Swords indicates that you might be experiencing anxiety or insecurity regarding the situation. You could be feeling restless and unsure about where things stand, prompting you to question your own perceptions and instincts. This card encourages you to seek clarity within yourself before trying to decipher the complexities around you.",
    "as_actions": "The arrival of the reversed Page of Swords suggests that now is a time for introspection and careful communication. You may need to pause before speaking or acting impulsively, as misunderstandings could arise from hasty words. Instead, focus on clarifying your thoughts and intentions. Consider journaling to articulate your feelings or engaging in deep conversations with trusted friends who can provide perspective. This card encourages you to embrace patience and mindfulness; take a step back from debates or conflicts, allowing yourself space to reflect on what truly matters. By doing so, you will cultivate clearer insights and healthier interactions moving forward."

  "abyss": "The Page of Swords is all about the search for knowledge and truth. She is the avid seeker who has just reached the point of epiphany and awe in the presence of pure knowledge, as depicted by the Sphere of Light. She represents the child-like state of the element of Air. Therefore, even though we see the discovery of wisdom or the realization of its presence, the Page is not yet able to process its full meaning; she is but a child with a keen intellect and a strong will. Since the Pages in general possess this child-like energy, she is tireless and enthusiastic—essential qualities that most often work in her favor. In general, Pages are the suit messengers. They are the ones who signal the challenges to come. Since we’re dealing with the Suit of Swords (i.e., the mind), we can assume that the issues that arise will be of a more intellectual nature. The messages she forebodes will not always be easy to confront, however, they always represent opportunities where one can apply the characteristics of the Page to the matter at hand. The presence of the Page urges you to embrace her qualities. Be relentless in your search for wisdom and truth. Use all of your mental acuity to pierce through the fog of the mind and move decisively toward your goal. Rely on your wits and acumen to seek and discover the root of the problem. The energy of the Page is straightforward and direct; she doesn’t bother with the high road or empty promises."
