  "abyss": "The Queen of Swords rests her head contemplatively upon the hilt of her sword, allowing its metallic coolness to center and still her. She makes use of that stillness to channel the knowledge emanating from the Sphere of Light affixed to the sword’s pommel. She is introspective and reflective, characteristics indicative of a strong queen. There are times when she must be as still as the night, yet as swift as an arrow in her decision-making. The Queen of Swords rules with her head first and her heart second, reason trumping her emotional yearnings. Yet, she bears a certain wisdom that places public responsibility above her private desires. It is no easy burden to bear, and there are times when it leaves her feeling very alone. In those moments of despair and despondency, she returns to the safety and security of her faithful blade, the keen and piercing intellect and indomitable will that have always safeguarded her on her journey through the twists and turns of the mysterious labyrinth. Regardless of how unpleasant it may be, the Queen of Swords must always face the truth in a situation with dignity and poise. Many people find this to be too much, preferring instead for the truth to be shrouded or silenced, in order to spare their feelings. The Queen is afforded no such luxury. Likewise, there are times when we have to harness the energy of the Queen of Swords, revealing truths to others that they don’t want to hear or are presently incapable of acknowledging. True friends are there to comfort and care for us, however, they also play the essential role of pointing out our poor choices or faulty judgments. If you are being called upon to play the part of the Queen of Swords, remember that it’s not just what you say, but how you say it. By phrasing and framing your critiques constructively, you are much more likely to have your message heard. Alternatively, if a dear friend or trusted companion is presently pointing out possible lapses of judgment on your part, have the courage and trust to at least consider their point of view."
