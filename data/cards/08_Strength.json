  "reversed": {

    "love_meaning": "In a love tarot reading, when Strength is reversed, the card can signal a bit of codependency in your relationship. This may stem from some forms of insecurity that make it difficult for you and your partner to be more independent and pursue your own interests. Being full individuals with your own lives brings more to your partnership; it doesn’t detract from it. Make sure that there is a strong sense of trust in your partnership. A reversed Strength tarot love meaning can also indicate that force and power are becoming more apparent themes in your relationship. One partner may be becoming more and more domineering, instead of empathic and understanding. You may have to make sure that one partner’s needs aren’t being trampled over in favor of another’s.",

  "abyss": "This card depicts a woman and her trusted companion, the lion. It is an unusual alliance, not something that just anyone could master. Relinquishing your fear is key, as the great beast can smell fear. The woman's hand holds the lion gently, a subtle hint at the power she possesses over this creature. She is calm, yet her gaze is steady as she becomes aware of our presence. In a way, she resembles her predator friend, on guard and perceptive of her surroundings. Her clothes are plain; there are no hints of worldly treasures. Her riches cannot be bought; they come from her abilities and her inner strength of character. She has mastered her emotions and conquered her anxieties. All the tools she needs to take on challenges are within her. The lion is a symbol of what we fear the most, and she has mastered that fear through equilibrium and inner strength. The Strength card appears when we need to take control of our internal environment. It's not a card about physical strength or any external influences that can be manipulated or controlled. It calls us to focus inwardly, to look deeply at those internal insecurities that cause us to doubt our own abilities. The greatest saboteur often lurks within. Remain fixed in your confidence and you will hold the reins to your emotions, as the woman holds dominion over the lion."
