  "description": "The Six of Cups symbolize the joy of nostalgia, the comfort of home and childhood innocence. In the card itself, there are six cups filled with white flowers. Two children are depicted in the foreground, and one is passing a cup to another. This handing of the flowers from the boy to the girl shows the passing of traditions and happy reunions. The children seem to be in a castle of sorts, that we can imagine give them a sense of security and comfort.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "The Six of Cups upright generally represents generosity, naïve happiness, and childhood. It can stand for you wanting to return to a happier time, whether it was when you were a child, teenager, or young adult. Many times, these memories are things of the past, which reflect the aspects of ourselves that have vanished. You may feel that remembering these times is the only way to feel happy. The Six of Cups appearing in a reading seems to indicate that while we may look upon the past with a happy eye, we must avoid living in it.\n\nThe Six of Cups can also mean that you are be returning to a familiar place. This could be your hometown, an old friend’s home, a school, or any place that holds a lot of meaning for you. You are seeking to reconnect with people from your past. Bringing back old memories reminds us of our childhood, a time when things were simpler.\n\nYou may be seeking the comfort and warmth of people that unconditionally love you.\n\nComing after the Five of Cups, this card can also suggest that you may have suffered a loss or disappointment of sorts, and you are making the journey home. You are looking to the past to find the answer to the crisis or challenge that you are facing now. You may be seeking the comfort and warmth of people that unconditionally love you, gathering strength to face the trials that are in front of you.",
    "love_meaning": "The past comes alive again with the 6 of Cups tarot love meaning. This card can signal a revival of the past and the nostalgia that comes with it; you may be exploring happy memories, you may be more appreciative your partner’s sense of familiarity, or an ex can even reappear in your life again. The 6 of Cups can also represent a time of healing after wounds, and comfort may be important to you now. If you and your partner have had a stressful period in your relationship, looking backwards at the great times you spent together, and perhaps reliving them, can bring you great comfort. Beware however, of living only in the past. Let the past nourish your future; they are lessons to show you what you want to remain in your life, and what you wouldn’t.",
    "career_meaning": "The six of cups often represents childhood, memories, and healing. When it comes to your career, now may be a good time to look backwards on the path that got you here.

This card is also related to childhood and home, signifying that this sharing may come from family members.

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "With the reversed 6 of Cups tarot love meaning, you may be living in the past instead of the present. It is likely that a past relationship has been limiting you from opening yourself to love and making room in your heart for someone else. You may believe that you will never meet someone like your ex again, or that the love you once had was something of legend. It can be rather unfair for current or potential partners to be with someone who lives this way. Exes are exes for a reason; you may be only seeing the happy memories, and not the tumultuous ones. Let the past go. Otherwise you may be blocking out all possibility of love again, and you may never know whether the love that you are meant have was even greater than the one you lost.",

    "career_meaning": "The reversed six of cups can suggest that your work has become stale, and that progress in your career has perhaps stalled. You may be so frustrated from this stifling atmosphere that you are in the process of searching for a more exciting position or field of employment. There can be the desire to leave the security and comfort of your current position. Alternatively, you may be choosing to remain in the comfort of your current position to avoid the risks of searching elsewhere. In general, there is an important lesson that needs to be learned when this card is in reverse. Beware of repeating any negative patterns that may have followed you in your past workplaces; regardless of where you go, your own behavior often can recreate the same problems again if it is not dealt with.",
    "finances_meaning": "Upright, this card is a sign of childhood and past memories. When reversed, the six of cups signifies that you are ready to set out on your own. This card is common for people who live at home but are ready to move out. It symbolizes that you are becoming financially mature. If you’ve been living with parents or others, you have better learned how to save and manage your funds, and you now have the discipline to make a life for yourself. These changes can be scary but necessary; enjoy the freedom that this brings you!",
    "as_feelings": "A reversed 6 of Cups can indicate a sense of nostalgia or longing for the past, but with a hint of sadness or regret. You may be romanticizing a past relationship, remembering only the happy moments, and feeling a sense of loss that it has ended. It is the feeling of being stuck in the past. Sometimes, this card can also suggest unresolved issues from childhood or past relationships that are resurfacing and need attention. On a less serious level, this card can simply be associated with feelings of boredom and apathy; that life has become repetitive.",
    "as_actions": "When it comes to actions, the reversed 6 of Cups suggest a tendency to dwell on the past or hold onto outdated beliefs and behaviors. You may be struggling to let go of old patterns, even if they are doing harm to your current situation. This card encourages taking proactive steps to break free from the past and embrace new opportunities for growth and transformation."

  "abyss": "Memories form a large part of who we are. The people we've met and interacted with in the past, our childhood, all of these and more, strung together form the picture of who we are as individuals. The Six of Cups is the card of review. We're reviewing things from our past relationships, childhood memories, or a love from the past, but now through a more objective lens. The Six of Cups can bring with it some nostalgia. Perhaps a reunion or a person from your past is making you think of all the things you thought were forgotten. And it's ok to think of the past as long as you don't start living in it. Memories are sometimes fickle, and we tend to remember things in a much better light than they truly were. So use the past to better your future; use the emotional lessons, but don't let yourself dwell too much in the past. If you're reading this card as a follow-up to the Five of Cups, where we had sorrow and regret, here we've moved beyond the sorrow. We are now reviewing things from our past relationships and can have a more objective stance."
