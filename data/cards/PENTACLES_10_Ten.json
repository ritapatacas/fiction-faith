He has his family and dogs with him. There is a happy couple in front of him, presumably his children and a playful child behind this couple, his grandchild. The child playfully reaches out to pet the dog.",

    "love_meaning": "Are you placing too much importance on what your family or others think about your partner? In an effort to find love, you may be searching for outside approval as well, instead of focusing on the emotional connection between the two of you. On the other hand, there may be conflicts between your lover and your family or friends. They may find that your partner is “unsuitable”; they may not have a good enough job, they may come from a different background, they may not be the Prince Charming that your family needs to show off how well their child is doing. Conflict now can have a great effect on your partnership, and you may have to assert your boundaries instead of accepting their opinions without thinking yourself.",
    "career_meaning": "If you own your own business, things may not be going well for you. In the worst case scenarios, it can suggest the dissolution of a company, debt, or bankruptcy. It may be time to revisit your business decisions and see what you can salvage. When it comes to careers, the 10 of Pentacles suggests that your job may be unstable, especially for the long term.

You may feel unfulfilled or anxious about future prospects, grappling with fears related to family dynamics or financial concerns. This card encourages you to reflect on what truly matters and consider how these insecurities are shaping your emotional landscape.",
    "as_actions": "In the presence of the reversed Ten of Pentacles, you are encouraged to reassess your values and priorities regarding family and legacy. This card indicates a need to break free from traditional expectations or material concerns that may be holding you back. Focus on nurturing relationships rather than accumulating wealth or status. Take time to connect with loved ones, perhaps by organizing a family gathering or reaching out to someone you've lost touch with. Embrace new experiences that foster personal growth, like volunteering in your community or pursuing a passion project that reflects your true self, rather than what is expected of you.",

  "abyss": "Two generations draw together with a simple handshake. This gesture transcends time and unites them in the passage of knowledge and wisdom, an embrace that offers counsel and protection. A spiral staircase winds its way from the older hand to the younger one, communicating the many lessons learned. The younger hand bears the fruitful tree from the Ace of Pentacles, while its roots reach back to the wizened hand of the older generation. What began so long ago as a seed has now bloomed and borne fruit. The Ten of Pentacles has at its core the concept of legacy and the impenetrable familial ties that bind. Therefore, when it appears in your reading, it indicates a renewed focus on these values at this time. The heritage of wisdom is our most valuable gift from our ancestors, sustaining us through times of trial and adversity. And just as it was passed down to you, either directly through your family line, or sometimes through your “extended family” of friends and respected elders, so too must you pass down what you have learned, along the spiral staircase to the next generation."
