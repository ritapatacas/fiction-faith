  "description": "The Six of Wands tarot card depicts a man who is currently wearing a wreath of victory around his head. He is depicted riding a horse through a crowd of people who are cheering. The horse is white, which is a well-known symbol of strength, purity as well as success. The crowd is there to show the public’s recognition for the achievements of the man riding the horse. The wand that the man is carrying also has a wreath which is tied to it in an attempt to further emphasize his success. The man is not afraid, or shy about all of this attention but rather proud with his accomplishments. To this, the crowd around him reacts with cheerfulness and enthusiasm.",

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "When the card is reversed, this suggests that you might find yourself doubting all of your abilities as well as your overall potential to achieve any kind of success. You might be feeling particularly negative about your entire self as if you have failed others as well as yourself. This is a symbol that means that you lack the confidence and drive that you need to achieve.

    "love_meaning": "Your confidence may be low right now; the reversed 6 of Wands tarot love meaning can suggest that you aren’t getting the kind of love that you believe you deserve. You may be feeling looked over, and rivals who don’t have the same loving, caring attitude that you do are finding themselves successful instead. Oftentimes, what is needed is an attitude change; ensure that this does not turn into bitterness. Confidence and positivity are attractive, and negativity often repels others. If you’re in a relationship, you or your partner may feel unappreciated or neglected.",
    "career_meaning": "When reversed the success generally associated with the six of wands is subverted. Instead of indicating triumph, in this position, the six of wands represents failure and a lack of ambition regarding work. It might be that you were passed over for a promotion or raise. If there was a recent conflict or competition at work, it likely did not or will not resolve itself in your favor. If there have not been such specific moments of tension, the six might be in reference to your general feelings at work. These feelings will manifest as a sense of stagnation or disinterest in projects. It could be that owing to a lack of drive, you feel stuck in your current position. Regardless of the exact context, this is a sign of underachievement.",
    "finances_meaning": "If the six of wands appears to you in this position, take a moment to reassess your finances. There has likely been a downturn in your financial situation. This can be due to a single negative event or represent the state of your economic affairs more broadly. If it is the former, an investment that you made may not have yielded results, or a purchase you made wasn’t what you thought it would be. If there have not been individual investments or purchases that have decreased your financial holdings, it is likely that your money is dwindling more slowly. Though it might not be a crisis, you may be going through trying times. It can be hard to muster the confidence to trust that things will improve. Work to be productive and proactive about your finances.",
    "as_feelings": "When you draw the reversed Six of Wands, it suggests that the person you are asking about may feel a sense of insecurity or self-doubt regarding their feelings for you. They might be struggling with feelings of inadequacy and fear that they cannot meet expectations, leading to a lack of confidence in expressing their emotions. This uncertainty can create distance as they grapple with how to navigate their affection.\nYou might sense a call to confront your own feelings, which may reflect a similar struggle; perhaps you're feeling overlooked or unappreciated in this connection. You might find yourself questioning your worth and whether you truly deserve recognition or validation from this person. The reversed Six of Wands invites both of you to confront these insecurities together, fostering an environment where open communication can help rebuild confidence and understanding between you.",
    "as_actions": "When you draw the reversed Six of Wands, it’s a signal to turn inward and embrace self-reflection. You may need to shift your focus from public recognition to personal achievements and inner growth. Consider setting aside time to reflect on your goals and values, ensuring they align with who you truly are. Engage in activities that nurture your self-esteem, such as journaling or pursuing hobbies that bring you joy without the pressure of competition. Additionally, reach out to trusted friends for honest feedback about your current path; their insights can help clarify what success means for you personally.",

  "abyss": "The graceful prima ballerina featured in the card bows, holding a large bouquet of flowers. She is humbled by the wild standing ovation she is receiving. Her performance looks easy and effortless, yet anyone who has ever attempted to do what she does knows that her level of excellence is only won through hours, years, and even decades of hard work and discipline. The Six of Wands symbolizes praise and recognition. After putting in much effort, you are finally getting the recognition you deserve! This recognition might occur at work, or any other place where you’ve recently been applying diligent effort. If you are a student, an award or scholarship could be on the way. Regardless of the success you achieve, however, be like the humble ballerina: in the instant that you believe you are the best, you no longer are. Keep your healthy ambitions in place, but keep your unhealthy ego in check. There is still much work to be done."
