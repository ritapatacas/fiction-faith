  "description": "The Five of Swords card depicts a young man who has a very convenient look of contempt on his face. He is looking at the enemies that he has managed to conquer. There are five swords that he possesses – which he has taken from the other combatants who are in the card. The two other figures are walking away from him in a slow manner with a sense of loss and sadness. Above them, the sky is tumultuous and cloudy, which indicates that not everything is well, despite the fact that the battle is already over.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "This card indicates that you are engaging in a conflict of some nature. It can also suggest a disagreement with others, which leads to hostility and tension. Despite the fact that you think you’ve won, you might still lose in the big picture, because you have annoyed or hurt those that you have argued with, and as a result, you are on the road to isolating yourself. Perhaps, at the moment, you believed that it was more important to be right rather than appreciate and understand where the other side was coming from.\nRight now, it's important to attempt to pick up the pieces. You still have the chance to act while the conflict is still fresh. You may feel as if everyone and everything is against you. You might also lose some friends along the way. This is why you will need to make a significant decision about your point of view. What is more important to you? Mutual progress, or winning? This might require you to stand up to a conflict within yourself.\n\nWhat is more important to you? Mutual progress, or winning?\n\nThe card represents ambition in a way which is rather negative. Too much ambition without actual regard to the consequences or the people that you affect is never something good. Misplaced ambition such as the one depicted by this card can leave you as a dejected loser or a callous winner – in both cases, the connotation is rather negative. This card instead asks us to be more considerate of those that we surround ourselves with, to let go of ego.",
    "love_meaning": "Unexpected change and uneasy energy can be signaled by the 5 of Swords tarot love meaning. There can be an anxious and demanding feeling in the air, making it easy for arguments and fights to materialize. You and your partner may feel irritable, and without taking some care, conflicts can be easy to start. Should you find yourself in one of these, you should think carefully about your reasons for being in this squabble, and make sure that you’re not arguing simply for the sake of being right. Egos may push you and your loved one to clash without any real reason. Sometimes, this can create passion when it is sorely needed, but can be damaging should it continue.",
    "career_meaning": "Conflicts are erupting at work, and considerable amounts of hostility is in the air. It can be easy right now for arguments to explode. This can come from misunderstandings, lack of communication, or poor leadership. The 5 of Swords can also signal bullying and intimidation. Whether it’s you or another person, you may be called upon to stand up for yourself or someone else. While it can be tempting, ensure that you handle the matter professionally, and don’t be afraid to pull in HR if you need to. Processes are usually in place to handle these situations. However, this card can equally point towards self-victimizing, meaning that your impression of the situation may be what is causing these conflicts in the first place. Defensive behavior usually creates a cycle of aggression, so be very clear with your own actions and how they affect this environment.",
    "finances_meaning": "You may be facing conflicts when it comes to money right now; whether it is with your partner, your family, or your friends. You’ll need to be extra cautious with your finances right now, especially when it comes to trusting others.

  "abyss": "A young man is playing God with a defenseless, trapped butterfly. He lords a pin over the powerless insect, knowing he could pierce it in a moment. He taunts it with his haughty air and domineering attitude. A sense of superiority is easily distinguished in his features, in his smirk and nonchalant posture. We don't know exactly what his choice will be. However, it is clear that he is not to be trusted. The Five of Swords is a card about ethics in our choices. Are you or is someone else in your life acting in an ethical manner? Of course, we know based on the principle of karma that if you hurt the people around you, your victory will be short-lived and incomplete. Building your happiness on the suffering of others will never spare you from the unflinching judgments of time and reflection. Is your sense of ego and selfishness affecting the situation? Winning at all costs is not winning at all, as it leaves the playing field scattered with dashed hopes and dreams. Perhaps you should take a different approach to your current circumstance; being a one-eyed king in the land of the blind does not make you righteous or truly powerful. If you are not the one who is acting in such a manner, sometimes this card can come up when you need to put yourself first. In cases where you're being mistreated, it's crucial to remove yourself from that abusive situation. Is there someone working against your best interests?"
