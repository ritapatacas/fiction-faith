  "description": "A man is shown carrying a heavy burden of wood, in the form of ten bundled wands, approaching a town which is not too far. This image on the ten of wands indicates a person who has already struggled in life and has succeeded, and he is now carrying the harvests to his final destination. Although he is not near the destination, it shows that he has finished the hardest part of life struggle and he just needs a place to relax and revel in his success.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "This card shows that you have already completed the circle of struggle. After spending too many resources and lots of energy looking for success, you have finally overcome the obstacles. The sweat off your brow was worth it - your efforts have finally been rewarded. You may find yourself living in a world of abundance where poverty and suffering have no chance to intervene.\nAlthough it sounds marvelous and satisfying, the card depicts a lot of responsibilities on your side. You are now the sole problem solver in your circle of family and friends which could even propel you into another world of challenges. At this point, you are also flooded with responsibilities to maintain your success. The businesses that you have started are flourishing and keeping you on your toes. The main problem is that these issues could overwhelm you if you lose control, which requires you to make sure that you know how to prioritize and solve the relevant ones.\n\nAlthough it sounds marvelous and satisfying, the card depicts a lot of responsibilities on your side.\n\nIn the real world, this card expresses how people try to burden themselves with responsibilities after they attain initial success. It is like graduating from college, getting a job and then starting to make it in the real world. More challenges keep coming, you may find yourself looking after you parents, starting a family and at the same time look to others, which may make you feel as though you not yet successful. It becomes a burden because at some point you find out nothing is enough to accomplish all these duties. The general lesson of the card is that people should be moderate, prioritize and understand that they cannot solve everything, some things must be let go, given to others, the burden shared.",
    "love_meaning": "Love may feel like a heavy burden with the 10 of Wands tarot love meaning. Other aspects of your life, like work or finances, may have weighed on you lately, making it difficult for you to be romantic. Sometimes, the stress may make you feel like your love life is just another burden for you to carry, instead of something that can help you carry your burdens. If you’re attached, don’t be afraid to ask for help. It can ease your lover’s worries, lighten your worries, and can also be a chance for the two of you to become closer together. If you’re single, don’t be afraid to spend some time on your own; everyone needs to focus on themselves before they can focus on finding a partner. Take care of yourself.",
    "career_meaning": "The ten of wands is a card of burden. This principle can apply easily to your work life. When upright, the ten suggests that you are feeling overworked. It might be that you have too many projects for you to handle on your own. See if it is possible to delegate or share your load with others. Collaboration and delegation are your greatest aids at this time. Do not be afraid to ask for assistance or speak up about an uneven distribution of work. If your workload is not particularly heavy right now, it might be that you find the tasks at hand uncommonly difficult or draining. It is still okay to ask for a hand if you need one.",
    "finances_meaning": "There is a financial burden weighing on you if you find the ten of wands upright regarding finances. This can take many forms. You could be faltering on debt payments or have other outstanding balances to consider. It might be that a large expense like school or a business loan is especially pressing right now. You might talk to someone about how best to resolve these issues. Do not do anything brash or generally inadvisable, but know that a professional might have dependable solutions that will help set you up for long term success.",
    "as_feelings": "The upright Ten of Wands reveals a heavy burden resting on their heart. They feel overwhelmed by life's demands, making it hard for them to fully connect with their feelings for you. While they see your worth, obligations and stressors cloud their emotional clarity.\nYour own feelings mirror this struggle. You might be feeling drained or stretched thin in this relationship, wrestling with the weight of expectations from yourself and others. Acknowledge these pressures and consider whether it's time to lighten your load so you can rediscover joy amid the heaviness.",
    "as_actions": "The appearance of the upright Ten of Wands points to the heavy burden you’re currently carrying, signaling it’s time to reassess your responsibilities. You should focus on prioritizing tasks and delegating where possible. Consider breaking down overwhelming projects into manageable steps, allowing yourself to breathe amidst the chaos. This card encourages you to shift your perspective; instead of viewing these burdens as obstacles, see them as opportunities for growth and resilience. Take action by creating a list of what truly matters, letting go of non-essential commitments, and seeking support from others when needed. Embrace this moment as a chance to lighten your load and regain balance in your life.",
    "love": "heavy burden of love, love creates responsibility, stress creates issues in relationship",
    "career": "being overworked, work burdens being carried alone, needing help from colleagues",
    "finances": "financial burden, large unavoidable expenses, struggling daily"
  },
  "reversed": {
    "overview": "When the Ten of Wands card is reversed, it indicates that you are truly burdened by circumstances which are not necessary in your life. Look around and see what is bothering you that will not positively impact yourself even if you rectify it. Drop them all and be a free being that can think soberly and do things accurately. Anything that does not add value in your life is not worth your time, so let it go.",
    "love_meaning": "You and your partner are meant to weather the burdens of life together, but one of you may still find it difficult to be vulnerable. Heavy burdens are not being shared, and that can lead to deterioration of your relationship. Instead of working as team, one person may be hoarding all the responsibilities, perhaps with the best of intentions, believing that it protects the other from stress, or worse, not trusting the other person to be able to help. If this is you, trust your partner; give them the chance to help you. When someone loves you, they want to see you happy, and helping you won’t be a burden, but a pleasure.",
    "career_meaning": "The ten of wands in this context represents an ending of work burdens. There are two ways this relief of pressure could have come about. One way you might have achieved this end was by successfully delegating work. Potentially, your realization that there was simply too much for one individual is being rewarded. Having better spread the bulk of your previous concerns out over a group, they now do not negatively impact any individual too terribly, and you are able to relax a bit. If you failed to delegate responsibility when it was required of you, you likely broke under the pressure of too many demands. Either way, you are no longer overworked and will have a quiet moment to recover.",
    "finances_meaning": "The ten of wands, when reversed here, has two potential meanings. It might be that you are coming out of a time of economic trouble. If you have taken steps to resolve the core issues that were undermining your finances, the ten can signify that you are finally able to take control of the situation. As a result, your finances will improve soon. Alternatively, if you have not worked to understand what is upsetting your financial state, you might be descending deeper into economic troubles. This card is situational to your life so consider how well you are in control of your finances to determine the meaning. Sometimes the other cards can help suggest which of the two readings is correct. More likely than not, however, if you cannot answer what steps you have taken to command your finances, it is likely that you have not acted decisively enough.",
    "as_feelings": "The arrival of the reversed Ten of Wands suggests that this person is experiencing relief and release from burdens they once carried. They may feel lighter in your presence, as if the weight of their responsibilities has lessened when thinking about you. This indicates a growing sense of freedom and perhaps even hope for what lies ahead together.\nWhen you draw the reversed Ten of Wands, it reflects a desire to let go of stress and overwhelm. You might be yearning for simplicity and ease in your life, recognizing that carrying too much can hinder your happiness. This card encourages you to prioritize self-care and seek balance, allowing yourself to embrace joy without the heaviness you've been accustomed to.",
    "as_actions": "The arrival of the reversed Ten of Wands suggests that it’s time to lighten your load and reassess what truly matters. You may be carrying burdens that are not yours to bear, leading to exhaustion and overwhelm. Now is the moment to delegate tasks or let go of responsibilities that drain you. Consider simplifying your life by prioritizing essential commitments and saying no to new obligations. Embrace a fresh perspective: view challenges as opportunities for growth rather than weighty burdens. Take action by creating a list of tasks, identifying which can be shared or eliminated, allowing space for rejuvenation and clarity in your journey ahead.",
    "love": "failure to share burdens with partner, finding emotional support from partner",
    "career": "relief from work burdens, finding support, delegating tasks, burn out",
    "finances": "relief from financial burden, finding assistance, deeper economic trouble"
  },
  "abyss": "The Ten of Wands depicts a young boy carrying a large, heavy basket of wood on his back. His journey is not an easy one; the terrain is rocky and the steep stairs make his task all the more toilsome. Still he makes progress step by step at a slow, steady pace. While most tarot decks show this card from the back or in profile, I decided to draw the boy ascending towards the viewer to highlight even more his sheer exhaustion, and so that we might identify more personally with him. The Ten of Wands hold challenges in store for those who receive it in their spread. It speaks of burdens and feeling the weight of heavy responsibilities. It may be that you have taken on too many commitments and overextended yourself. While each independent activity might be enjoyable, it is hard to enjoy any of them when you are exhausted from carrying too onerous a load. In other cases, we may not have a choice as to the load we bear. Perhaps a job feels too demanding or overly taxing? Regardless of the specific source of your stress, the Ten of Wands warns you to be careful, as such burdensome responsibilities can have real impacts on your health. If at all possible, try to cut back on your activities. This is a card that reminds you to shift your focus and think more about yourself for a change."
