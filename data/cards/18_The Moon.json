  "description": "When we encounter the Moon, we see a path that leads off into the distance. On either side of the path stand a wolf and a dog, representing our animalistic nature - one is civilized, and the other wild and feral. There is a crawfish that is crawling out of the pond from which the path stems from. In the distance, we can see two towers flanking the central path, once again alluding to the doubles visible in this card. Everything in this card seems to echo the other, as if to allude to two possibilities. When we walk down the path, we walk the fine line between conscious and unconscious, between the tamed side of civilization of the dog, and the forces of nature represented by the wolf.\n\nThe towers on the opposing ends represent the forces of good and evil, and their similarity in appearance can allude to the difficulties that we face in distinguishing between them.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "On one hand, the Moon card can symbolize your imagination is taking the best of you. In the dark of the night, you are taking a path that you are unsure of, for there could be danger lurking in its depths. You are the crawfish embarking on the path in the card. The moon's light can bring you clarity and understanding and you should allow your intuition to guide you through this darkness.\n\nThe moon's light can bring you clarity and understanding and you should allow your intuition to guide you through this darkness.\n\nYou need to be aware of the situations that are causing fear and anxiety in your mind, whether it is now or in the future. It alerts you not to allow inner disturbances and self-deception to take the best of you. These deep memories and fears must be let go, and the negative energies must be released and turned into something constructive.\nAnother reading of the Moon card is the existence of illusion. Some hidden truth must be discovered, for what you are seeing now may just be a trick of the light. You must search for the hidden forces that must be unraveled.",
    "love_meaning": "With the Moon in a love tarot reading, it’s likely that emotions are complicated at this time. The environment can be one full of misunderstandings, and not everything is as it appears. You may need to do some work to get to the bottom of things; be sure to not only ensure the intentions of others, but also understand your own emotions, desires and motivations. There may be old attitudes, beliefs or ideas that are clouding your judgement. Many things can be hiding in your unconscious affecting your ability to accept love. Are past relationships haunting you? Have you lost faith in love? Do you believe you are unworthy of love? All of these can have profound affects on how we approach relationships. Now is the time to examine them and reveal them as they truly are.",
    "career_meaning": "There may be some uncertainty when it comes to your career path right now.

    "love_meaning": "The reversed Moon tarot love meaning can suggest that confusion and deception may be in the air. You may not have all the information you need at this moment, and you’ll have to rely on intuition in order to guide your way to the truth. Are you being honest with your partner? Are they being honest with you? Sometimes deception doesn’t necessarily have to have malicious motivations, but can even be done out of kindness or the desire to spare another person’s feelings. Hiding the truth however, is never a sustainable situation.",

  "abyss": "Near the edges of two cliffs, two figures stand, wrapped in rays of luminescent moonlight. The male stands upon the right cliff, while his female counterpart stands upon the left cliff. They represent the primordial active and passive energies, spirit and matter, light and dark. There is only a small gap between them, making it easy for them to cross and unite. Yet, one false step could be their undoing. The Moon governs the tides. Its ever-changing phases exert a constantly shifting influence upon the waters of the Earth, as well as upon our emotional lives. Each one of us is connected to the Moon through occult energies that shift our emotional bodies. In contrast to the Sun, which shines constantly and reliably, completely illuminating the world—the Moon provides only intermittent and indirect light. The Moon provides general impressions but cannot be relied upon to reveal the whole truth. There is something mystical to its permanence, its stillness and silence. For this reason, it is important to proceed with caution. When the Moon card appears in your reading it signals a period of fluctuation and change. For most of us, the inability to clearly distinguish our surroundings instills a sense of fear and anxiety reminiscent of childhood fears of the dark. Moonlight dances lightly at nighttime, it hints but doesn't reveal all, and what we see by moonlight can turn out to be quite different in daylight. Therefore, it is not at all difficult to misperceive objects or intentions. Beware then of false impressions throughout this period, as it's quite easy to lose your step and be deceived. It's also wise not to make any major decisions or changes during this time."
