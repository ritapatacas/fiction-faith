    "overview": "The Eight of Cups signifies time for change or transition, by means of walking away from something. Just like a caterpillar has to die before transforming into a beautiful butterfly, we all need to transform ourselves in our lives from time to time. This is the case especially after being tired of living what was the day to day, and embarking on a journey that will help one have a deeper understanding about life in general.\nGetting the upright side of this card shows that you are dissatisfied with your life and need to experience a higher purpose in life. You may have been exploring your options, flitting about from one choice to another, tasting the wine in each cup, as a means to sort out what it is that you really want with your life. You are now experiencing a feeling of exhaustion - and are coming to a realization that you must step away from what is familiar. It is a choice, and a recognition that true happiness will not be found in what you have already created.\n\nYou are coming to a realization that you must step away from what is familiar.\n\nMore often than not, getting the Eight of Cups shows that one is tired of the worldly things and is about to embark on a much more spiritual journey.

    "overview": "With the reversed 8 of Cups tarot love meaning, your gut may be telling you that you need to leave your partnership, but there is something that holds you back. It is important to engage this and question that fear. It is so very difficult to give up what has been built, the time and emotions and energy that we have invested into another person, but sometimes one must be wise enough to leave something that truly isn’t working behind. You’ll have to work out whether the desire to leave comes from the relationship truly reaching its end, or whether it is still salvageable. Give yourself time to get a clear head about what you need to do, and address whatever it is that prevents you from moving on.",

  "abyss": "She's had enough. The woman pictured in the card is tossing her cup and leaving it all behind. She is moving on, leaving behind a rundown cabin and all of her belongings with it. There is no sadness in her eyes, only determination and courage. A sense of freedom grows inside her with every step she takes. The Eight of Cups is the card of moving on from a situation or place that is no longer bringing you joy. It's the start of a new journey, one that will not be easy since you're now starting from scratch. Nonetheless, it can be an interesting one, full of new possibilities. Whether it's an actual trip or an inner journey is for you to decide. One thing is for sure, an old cycle is closing and a new one is beginning. It takes a long time for us to admit when something is not working for us. Perhaps we've outgrown a career or a relationship. Change is never easy and the unknown is scary. However, you know very well that this change is inevitable and it is coming."
