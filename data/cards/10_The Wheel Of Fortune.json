  "description": "The Wheel of Fortune is one of the most highly symbolic cards in the deck, filled with signs that each have its own meaning. At the center of the card, lies a giant wheel, covered in esoteric symbols. There are different creatures that surround the wheel; the angel, the eagle, the bull and the lion. They are related to four fixed signs in the zodiac - leo, taurus, scorpio and aquarius. These four animals are also representatives for the four evangelists in Christian traditions, which is perhaps the reason that they are all adorned with wings.\n\nThe books that each of the creatures hold represents the Torah which communicates wisdom and self-understanding. The snake indicates the act of descending into material world. On the wheel itself, rides a sphinx that sits at the top, and what appears to be either a devil, or Anubis himself arising at the bottom. These two Egyptian figures are representative of both the wisdom of the gods and kings (in the case of the sphinx) and the underworld (Anubis). They are rotating forever, in a cycle, and suggests that as one comes up, the other goes down.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "The Wheel of Fortune turns evermore, seemingly to communicate that life is made up of both good and bad times, and that the cycle is one that we cannot control. It is something that is subjected to both kings and workers, and that nobody on earth can avoid what is fated. When you have good moments in your life, make sure that you enjoy to the fullest, for what comes up must always go down. The same is true in reverse - when you are in a bad situation, things will eventually become better again.\n\nThe same forces that govern the changing of the seasons, or the rising and setting of the sun is also the master of luck and the fate of individuals.\n\nGreater forces that are outside of human control are at work here. The same forces that govern the changing of the seasons, or the rising and setting of the sun is also the master of luck and the fate of individuals. Where it lands is as random as chance - you may find yourself at either the top or bottom, but remember that no matter what the outcome it may not last for very long, for the wheel always turns.",
    "love_meaning": "Life is full of unexpected changes, and love is no different. The Wheel of Fortune tarot love meaning can signal great changes in your relationship, perhaps one that you didn’t see coming.

Should you choose to make the choice, your partnership may become closer than ever as the two of you learn to navigate the ups and downs of life together as a team. It is important to understand that whether the changes are positive or negative, they are not forever, for the wheel is always turning.",
    "career_meaning": "Big changes may be coming when it comes to your career. Should you be considering making a switch in your career path or your position, now may be a good time to make those moves. Try and be more aware of the opportunities that are in your environment for you now, and say yes when they arise.

Should you be dealing with material hardship, be assured that this not meant to last forever. Keep your eyes open to any opportunities that open up to you.",
    "as_feelings": "When the Wheel of Fortune appears upright in a reading about how someone feels about you, it reveals their emotions are shifting and evolving. They experience an exhilarating sense of possibility, as if fate has intertwined your paths for a purpose. This person recognizes that your connection is part of a larger cycle, filled with highs and lows, that ultimately fosters growth and transformation. Their feelings dance between excitement and uncertainty, influenced by life's unpredictability.\nThis card also prompts you to examine your own emotions.

Your feelings reflect an awareness of life’s constant evolution, encouraging you to adapt while staying optimistic about what lies ahead in your shared journey.",

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "When the wheel is reversed, it means that luck has not been on your side and misfortunes have been following you. When it's associated with this card, you must understand that these are due to external influences that you cannot control. Like the wheel, our luck and our fate is always in motion, and sometimes we are on the bottom. Be assured that the wheel will turn again, and you will be okay again soon.\nWhat you shouldn't do however, is cling to the illusion of control. Perhaps in this turn of the wheel, the lesson is to learn to let go and release. There are things that cannot be moved by human will and action alone. When we do not let go, it can bring only more suffering, for you may blame yourself for actions that could not have altered the situation. When we learn to accept, we also learn to forgive ourselves. We learn to move on, and move forward - and eventually, we learn that this feeling of acceptance can push the wheel again forward, and move it towards a new cycle.",
    "love_meaning": "There are times, that no matter how much we try, the world will not bend to one’s will. Life may have thrown an unexpected wrench into your plans, and there is not much that you can do other than remember that this too will pass. It is likely that some external factor may be affecting your relationships right now, and you may have to adapt to it, and accept it with patience rather than attempting to control this situation. Other aspects of your life may be demanding right now, as your romantic life may have to take a pause. If you are in a partnership, try and tackle these problems as a team and communicate openly.",
    "career_meaning": "Are things in your work life changing quickly? You may find it difficult to keep up at the moment. All these surprises are things that may feel disruptive to your plans. You may keep trying to make a past solution work, instead of flowing alongside the events that are unfolding right now. It is important to not cling to the past or your expectations, but instead remain flexible and ready to change your plans. Are your responsibilities changing at work? Does your project’s requirements keep updating? This can be very frustrating, but instead of fighting it, try and figure out your own process to deal with it. It’s important to make sure you find your center.",
    "finances_meaning": "Be wary of taking risks when it comes to your finances, as this card can suggest unexpected and unwelcome events. It may be wise right now to build a small emergency fund; even if nothing does happen, having something stowed away can help relieve anxiety about what comes next. The world is constantly changing, make sure you’re ready for it.",
    "as_feelings": "The appearance of the reversed Wheel of Fortune points to a sense of unpredictability and instability in how this person feels about you. They may feel uncertain or even frustrated, as if circumstances beyond their control are influencing their feelings toward you. This card indicates they might be struggling with change and are unsure how to navigate their connection with you, leading to mixed signals or hesitance.\nWith regard to your own feelings, the reversed Wheel of Fortune reflects a similar turmoil within yourself. You could be grappling with anxiety about the future or feeling stuck in a cycle that seems unending. There may be moments when you question your choices and wonder if you're on the right path. It’s essential to recognize these feelings as part of life's ebb and flow; embracing uncertainty can lead to growth and new opportunities ahead.",
    "as_actions": "The arrival of the reversed Wheel of Fortune suggests that you should embrace a period of introspection and reevaluation. This is your cue to take control of your circumstances rather than leaving things to chance. Focus on identifying patterns in your life that may be holding you back, such as negative habits or unproductive relationships. Take actionable steps like journaling to clarify your thoughts, setting specific goals for personal growth, or seeking guidance from mentors who can offer fresh perspectives. By actively engaging with these changes, you will create opportunities for positive transformation and regain a sense of direction in your life.",
    "love": "external events affecting relationship, love life out of control",
    "career": "failure to adapt at work, forcing past solutions",
    "finances": "unexpected financial changes, preparation"

  "abyss": "The weaver holds the wheel of time, an endless spiral that can influence the events of life itself. She bears no ill will, nor does she control where or when it stops. She is simply the guardian and wheel. She has existed here since the beginning of time itself and her name is Infinity. She neither rests nor sleeps. She is a constant witness to the world, viewing its highs and lows with impassivity and temperance. Fate can be a very fickle friend, one moment whisking you to the heights of bliss and fulfillment, the next, dropping you to the depths of loss and despair. The spiral of time has its own motivations, its all-seeing eye ever open and awake. When the Wheel of Fortune appears in your spread, know that times are changing. If your life has been stagnant, know that big changes are afoot. If you've had a run of bad luck lately, your life will soon change for the better. Conversely, if things have been spectacular, brace yourself for unexpected changes or obstacles. This is not a subtle card; the Wheel will turn things upside down and its impact could potentially have lifelong repercussions. It often alters the course of your life to a greater extent than anticipated; nor can these changes be helped or avoided. When it comes to karmic influences, there is very little we can do to control the events that befall us. However, we always retain control over our reactions to and perceptions of these life changes. Often our greatest strength is in our adaptability to the changes that inevitably occur in life. Seek to establish a healthy perspective of the changes that befall you and much of the battle is won."
