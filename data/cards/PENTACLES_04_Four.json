  "description": "This card depicts a man who is sitting on a stool, who is holding onto two pentacles in a very defensive and tight posture. It’s almost as if he is hoarding them out of fear of loss. One pentacle is balanced precariously on his head, while another one is tightly clutched between his own hands, and there are two of them which are securely placed underneath his feet. He is making sure that there is absolutely no one touching his coins. At the same time, he is also unable to move because he is holding the coins so tightly. In other words, he is restrained from acting because he is holding too tight to his possessions. To some, money does not always bring freedom.",

    "overview": "The Four of Pentacles card is capable of generating both negative and positive perceptions. On one hand, the card signifies that you have successfully managed to accomplish much of your goals and you have managed to attain a significant material wealth in the process. However, on the other hand, there is a significant chance that you will start valuing things only for their material worth. You have worked hard to get to the point where you are now, and it is absolutely natural for your to desire to make sure that you remain stable. But this also has a chance to turn you into an overly possessive or greedy person who wants to ensure that no one is capable of taking away your own wealth.\n\nThere is a chance to turn you into an overly possessive or greedy person who wants to ensure that no one is capable of taking away your own wealth.\n\nThe Four of Pentacles is also a card which shows that you are currently in a position in which you have solid investments and that you are financially stable. Because of your new-found wealth, you are being particularly conservative about money, and you are most definitely not inclined to gamble when it comes to any kind of financial matters. You are protective of what you have managed to accumulate throughout time, and you desire to steadily increase your overall net worth.\n\nBe aware that without risk, there is no reward - if you spend too much of your time attempting to conserve, you may become a prisoner to your own material possessions. Wealth is a kind of energy as well, and we create what we express.",
    "love_meaning": "Your relationship can be clingy and even suffocating, with the 4 of Pentacles tarot love meaning. Relationships with this card can be filled with jealousy and possessiveness, which can slowly deteriorate even the happiest of loves. There are likely issues with insecurity or fear involved, and lovers may have to take some time to untangle these issues before they drive away their partner. If you’re single, there is likely you’re still holding onto something from your past romances; whether it is grudges, resentment or the dream of an ex returning to your life. These things need to be resolved before you can truly be open to another lover again.",
    "career_meaning": "You have finally found some stability in your career right now, with the 4 of Pentacles appearing in your work spread. If you’ve struggled in the past to find this stability, or if the job is new to you, it may be that you’re still a bit insecure about your role. This can make you guarded, uneasy and perhaps even paranoid. This can do you more harm than good if you let it go too far. You may find it hard to collaborate and work as a team, feeling protective of your ideas, and worried that others may get the credit that rightfully belongs to you. These things do happen, address them, but don’t let yourself be consumed by them.\n\nSometimes this card can also mean you are remaining in an unfulfilling job just to collect your paycheck. This job may be stable, but you may truly hate it there.",
    "finances_meaning": "You may have recently just found some material stability, and as such you have been able to accumulate a little fortune. If you’re used to struggling, you may think about your finances a lot, trying to do whatever you can to protect this small fortune. You can be rather frugal and conservative with your money, even if it causes you a lot of extra work or distress. Alternatively, the 4 of Pentacles can simply suggest that you are saving for something big, like a car or new home, a child’s future, or your own retirement fund.",
    "as_feelings": "The Four of Pentacles reveals a strong desire for security and possessiveness. This person clings tightly to what they have with you, driven by a need for stability that often masks their fear of loss or vulnerability. They value your presence but may struggle to express their emotions fully because of this protective instinct.\nOn your end, the Four of Pentacles suggests you're wrestling with similar feelings. You might be guarding your heart, hesitant to open up completely. While you recognize that holding on too tightly can lead to stagnation, the comfort in familiarity makes it difficult to let go. Consider whether this urge for control is truly benefiting you or if it's time to welcome change and foster emotional growth instead.",
    "as_actions": "You might sense a call to focus on stability and security in your life. This card encourages you to assess what truly matters to you, urging a shift from mere accumulation to mindful stewardship of your resources. Consider organizing your finances or decluttering your space, as these actions can create a sense of control and peace. Additionally, reflect on how you hold onto relationships or opportunities; are they serving you? Embrace generosity by sharing knowledge or time with others, fostering connections that enrich rather than restrict. By doing so, you'll cultivate a more balanced approach to both material and emotional wealth.",
    "love": "clingy lover, jealousy, feeling insecure, holding onto past",
    "career": "impostor syndrome, paranoia, avoiding collaboration",
    "finances": "stable finances, frugality, saving for future"
  },
  "reversed": {
    "overview": "When reversed, the Four of Pentacles veers sharply into the negative meanings of the card. Instead of being protective you become greedy, and you succumb to stinginess. You are haunted by certain fears of poverty which compels you to be nothing but materialistic. You are incredibly self-protective and defensive in terms of materialistic things, and you are not opening up to trust other people out of fear that they may be taking them away.\nOn the other side, you might actually be spending too much money, and you need to start getting a proper hold of your actual financial resources. In any case, the card is capable of inducing both positive and negative associations, and you need to be very accountable and considerate if you get the Four of Pentacles in a reading.",
    "love_meaning": "Past insecurities may be healing now, allowing you or your lover to be less jealous and possessive. The reversed 4 of Pentacles love meaning can therefore signal that the relationship can move forwards without being hindered by past wounds. If you’re single, it may be that you are ready to finally open your heart to new love, and have let go of something that has prevented you from letting your romantic life flourish.",
    "career_meaning": "The reversed 4 of Pentacles may be a little tricky to interpret. Positive associations suggest that your warmhearted and generous nature at work can be a powerful asset for you. You are readily available to help others and give credit where credit is due. Alternatively, you may instead be making risky decisions and careless of the consequences. Avoid trying to do the flashiest project, or shoot for the most ambitious, irrational goal right now, as it can land you in trouble rather than help you.",
    "finances_meaning": "At times, the reversed 4 of Pentacles can signal that you’re slowly learning how to open up your pocketbook. You may generally be frugal, you are learning that it can feel good to give to others, or use your money in helpful ways. You may be donating or sharing your resources with family or friends, or purchasing things based on quality instead of price. Other times however, you can be rather careless about your money; this can make you an easy target for thieves, or shady financial schemes. Be on the lookout.",
    "as_feelings": "When you pull the reversed Four of Pentacles in relation to how someone feels about you, it reveals a sense of release and openness. This person is beginning to let go of their fears around vulnerability and possessiveness, allowing themselves to feel more freely towards you. They may be shedding past insecurities that once held them back, indicating a willingness to embrace deeper emotional connections with you.\nWith regard to your own feelings, this card suggests that you're experiencing a shift as well. You might find yourself craving freedom from old patterns or attachments that no longer serve you. There’s an urge within you to explore new possibilities and experiences without clinging too tightly to what you've known before. Embrace this transformative energy; it's guiding both your heart and theirs toward greater emotional fulfillment.",
    "as_actions": "In the presence of the reversed Four of Pentacles, you’re encouraged to let go of control and embrace change. This card encourages you to release your grip on material possessions or rigid beliefs that may be holding you back. Consider decluttering your space, donating items you no longer need, or even reassessing financial habits that limit your freedom. Emotionally, it’s time to open up; share your thoughts with trusted friends or family instead of keeping everything bottled up. By allowing yourself to be vulnerable and adaptable, you'll create room for new opportunities and experiences in both life and relationships.",
    "love": "overcoming jealousy, release from past lovers",
    "career": "generosity with colleagues, risky work decisions",
    "finances": "spending, donating, sharing resources"
  },
  "abyss": "The Four of Pentacles is about planning for the future and making sure you have the resources you need. However, at the same time, if we place too much value on accumulating material things, ironically, we can become owned by the very things we seek to own. Rather than us owning and controlling them, our psyches are “owned” by the desire to accumulate and possess wealth. The card illustrates a man coveting his coins. He holds onto them very tightly, terrified of losing them. The coins are far larger than any real coin might be, indicating the value and importance he places upon them. He's become too focused on the coins. He has lost sight of the fact that they are intended to serve him, not the other way around. Are you going through a financial hardship at the moment? If so, the Four of Pentacles is warning you to be conservative with your spending and focus instead on saving. However, if that's not the case, the Four of Pentacles can take on a different meaning. Perhaps you are focusing too much on the money. Let go of the purse strings a little; it's ok to have fun here and there. After all, you can't control everything. Being in control of our finances is very important; however, remember that material possessions ought not be the focus of our lives."
