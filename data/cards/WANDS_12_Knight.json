  "abyss": "The Knight of Wands cradles in his hand an intriguing creature, a Fire Elemental. We can see the Page of Wands in the background, who stands ready with the wood and kindling she has collected. She has prepared the base for the fire, but without the creative spark the Knight of Wands has harnessed, no fire can exist. The Knight tends to the Fire Elemental carefully, shielding and protecting it from the wailing winds of the forest. His is the essential task of presenting the Fire Elemental to the Queen, that she might then ignite the bonfire. The Knight of Wands can sometimes appear when an important event will come to pass. It is a good card to receive in a reading, since it also brings with it a period of great creative potential.

The Knight of Wands is a passionate individual who involves himself completely in any situation that he deems exciting. In the extreme, he can be a daredevil who recklessly throws caution to the wind, endangering himself and others. If you receive this card in your reading, ask yourself if you or anyone around you is exhibiting these traits."
