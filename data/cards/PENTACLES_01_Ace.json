  "description": "In this card, there is a single mysterious hand that comes out of the clouds. In the hand is what looks like a gold coin with a pentagram engraved on its surface. This pentacle is associated with the element of earth, and seen as a sign of wealth and all things material and earthly. Below the hand is a garden which appears to be flourishing with flowers and other kinds of vegetation - giving off the aura of fertility, growth and prosperity. The mountain represents the ambition required to drive one's search for the pentacle. The flowing creek seem to indicate that emotions are flowing towards this ambition.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "The aces in the tarot are all indicative of new beginnings. When you draw any of them, it means that you are at a point in your life where a new cycle is beginning - you are about to start afresh.\n\nBecause the suit of pentacles is primarily concerned with all things material (not just financial, but also with the sensual), this reset could manifest itself as a new career, the undertaking of a new venture, or the start of putting more care into your health. Wherever this beginning takes place, the Ace of Pentacles assures that what is to come will bring great abundance and opportunity.\n\nWatering this seed has the potential to be very rewarding - for anything that is grown on this energy is meant to be stable, secure and give a good yield.\n\nTo see the Ace of Pentacles indicates a seed being planted in the material world, in your feelings of security and stability. Like a seed, this opportunity must also be nurtured, and sometimes invested in with energy, time or funds. Watering this seed has the potential to be very rewarding - for anything that is grown on this energy is meant to be stable, secure and give a good yield. Prosperity is coming your way.\nOne also has to make sure that they are psychologically prepared for the opportunities that are appearing. To be able to harvest the gift of the pentacles, we need to be filled with the calm that stability brings - this is a kind of spiritual prosperity, if you will. This kind of mindset can mean we become open to trying new things and not sticking to the old, washed out routine.",

If you’re single, make sure to take care of your practical life as well, as this will give you the foundation you need to find a love that can flourish.",
    "career_meaning": "New opportunities are available to you now, that can secure you a better job, or a higher position in your existing company.

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "Though the Ace of Pentacles usually heralds an opportunity of some sort that would lead to great gains, to see it reversed can mean that this might be a poor investment, requiring much more resources than you had initially reserved - or alternatively, you might be missing your chance.\n\nWhen one gets a reversed Ace of Pentacles, it may mean that they are about to face hard financial times as well as a lot of elusive opportunities. At this time, you are being advised against taking large financial risks and to think all your choices through when you are given a deal.\nIt might also be a good time for an individual to seek advice from others and avoid making rushed decisions since the time isn’t just right. It wouldn’t be a good time for one to jump into a new job or business opportunity - especially if the main motivation for joining is to pursue prospects of higher financial gain. It might just be an illusion that can lead to your downfall.",
    "love_meaning": "The reversed Ace of Pentacles Tarot Love Meaning can suggest that a relationship that once gave you a sense of stability may instead be making you feel anxious and vulnerable. There may be concerns about finances that are creeping into the relationship, which can make the two of you feel unstable. Sometimes, this can be alleviated with an honest discussion and a game plan moving forward. Other times, the material or practical worries that you are dealing with now can be temporary, and solved with some careful budgeting. If you’re not in a relationship, be wary of people that seem selfish, greedy or willing to take advantage of you. This card can also simply signal missed romantic opportunities.",
    "career_meaning": "Did you feel like you missed your chance to get that promotion you have been coveting? There is likely to be some sort of feeling of instability or missed opportunities with the reversed Ace of Pentacles. You may not feel like you’re doing well in your job, and you may be paranoid about getting fired for poor performance. Some of this may be impostor syndrome, but some concerns may be real. You’ll need to take a realistic look at yourself. You may also be feeling as though you haven’t spent your time wisely, and made some bad decisions in your career path. You haven’t invested in a career that has brought you material and emotional rewards. It’s not too late to change that; think more about what you’d like to do.",
    "finances_meaning": "If you haven't been focusing or looking at your finances recently, now may be the time. Poor planning may have meant that you have made some bad financial decisions. This can be a time of scarcity for you; you’ll have to learn how to pinch pennies in order to make it through. At worst, this can indicate a financial emergency; you may not be ready for it.",
    "as_feelings": "The arrival of the reversed Ace of Pentacles suggests that this person may be feeling uncertain or insecure about the potential for a lasting connection. They might perceive obstacles or lack clarity regarding their feelings, leading them to question whether investing emotionally is worthwhile. Their hesitation could stem from past experiences that have left them wary of new beginnings.\nIn terms of your own feelings, the reversed Ace of Pentacles indicates a sense of frustration or disappointment with your current situation. You may feel as though opportunities are slipping away or that you're not fully realizing your potential in this relationship. This card encourages you to reflect on what truly matters and consider how you can cultivate stability and growth within yourself before seeking it externally.",
    "as_actions": "The arrival of the reversed Ace of Pentacles suggests that you should reassess your current approach to opportunities and resources. This card indicates a need to shift your perspective on what success means to you. Instead of chasing material gains, focus on nurturing your inner wealth; your skills, passions, and relationships. Take time to evaluate where you're investing your energy; consider starting a new hobby or learning something that excites you. Additionally, declutter your physical space to create room for fresh ideas and possibilities. Embrace this moment as an invitation to cultivate abundance from within rather than relying solely on external validation or possessions.",

  "abyss": "The Suit of Pentacles corresponds to the element Earth. Wanting to form a bridge between the soil that sustains us and all living things, I chose an image that focuses on the absolute dependency of man upon the Earth for sustenance and survival. The card depicts a branching tree in the shape of a man. Its roots tunnel deep underground, drawing nourishment and life from the earth's fecundity. The branches are heavy with ripe fruit, signifying prosperity and abundance. The Ace of Pentacles is all about building a strong financial foundation. When the Ace of Pentacles surfaces in your reading, it often brings with it some sort of financial opportunity. Since it is the first card of the Suit of Pentacles, we need to understand that this only demonstrates potential; you will still have to put in the work to actualize it. This is the time to launch new financial or commercial opportunities. The Ace of Pentacles may also indicate a career change or promotion. If, however, your question was about a romance, the Ace of Pentacles points to a serious, long-term relationship."
