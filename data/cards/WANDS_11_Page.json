The desert in the background behind him both is indicative of his element, fire, and also represents that he is living in a world that has not bared fruit yet. His ideas are therefore completely hypothetical. However, if he were to choose to use them, and undertake the journey of his suit, his purity of heart could lead him to find better fortunes.",

If he doesn't learn to control this, it might be that he squanders the opportunities to advance himself.\n\nWhen you get the Page of Wands, it simply means something is within you, something that triggers you to make discoveries, indulge in investments or take the next advancement in life.\n\nWhen you get the Page of Wands, it simply means something is within you, something that triggers you to make discoveries, indulge in investments or take the next advancement in life.
