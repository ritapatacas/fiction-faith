  "description": "The Eight of Wands is depicted as eight flying staves that appear as if they are suspended in the air. Some may look at them as wands that are blossoming that are traveling at a maximum speed. The background where they travel through is a clear sky which represents that there is likely nothing that will stand in the way of these making it to their destination. It shows a majestic landscape with a river that is streaming, the water breathing life to the image. The wands also appear like they are about to land, which signals the end of a long journey.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "The image depicted by the Eight of Wands means that the difficulties that were brought by the Seven of Wands are finally over. It signifies a strong level of energy which states that different aspects of your life will be trailblazing. Perhaps important news will be coming on your way, and you may experience a sudden, yet steady positive growth. The Eight of Wands meaning may also pertain to your work. There is a chance that the decision that you are waiting for will come your way soon. You need to be patient and just wait for it.\n\nPerhaps important news will be coming on your way, and you may experience a sudden, yet steady positive growth.\n\nWhen it comes to love, the eight of wands meaning pertains to your readiness to be committed on a relationship; however, the card advises you not to force the other party to also be ready on the commitment. Your significant other will soon be ready - forcing things to happen may affect the result negatively. In terms of finances, it appears like this is not the best time to make hasty investment. Just like in your love aspect, we advise you to be patient. Save your money and wait for the perfect time to invest. All things that you fought for are building in momentum. Where you didn't see progress earlier, you'll soon discover that they paved the way for the coming wave of action.",

Make sure you’re ready to take advantage of this sometimes frantic energy. If you’re currently in an existing relationship, surprises can be in store, giving the two of you some excitement in your relationship. It is likely that these surprises will be welcome ones, but other cards in the spread will help give more context.",
    "career_meaning": "The eight of wands represents rapid movement forward. Applied to your career, this principle can mean rapid movement in the literal or figurative sense.

Go forth with confidence that you will continue to surpass expectations.",
    "finances_meaning": "The speed associated with the eight of wands applies to your money in this position. It could seem like money is out of your hands as quickly as it came into them. This tendency is not inherently good or bad. Your ability to prosper at this time depends on your ability to remember just how much came in and how much went out. While it is particularly tempting right now, be warned against impulsive spending if you see this card here. The old adage “easy come, easy go” might merit repeating for the next little while.",

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "Just like the upward Eight of Wands, the Eight of Wands reversed meaning is generally associated with patience. There is a possibility that you are feeling frustrated about something. You might now see that what you set in motion earlier created the obstacles that you are discovering right now. It is time for you to understand that you cannot change the past. You must forgive yourself, and adapt your strategy.\nIn terms of work, there may be an existing disagreement in your office. You need to settle this quickly in order to avoid derailing any major issue. Breathe, think and try to relax. Be patient and believe that everything will be just fine. The Eight of Wands reversal meaning on love may pertain to possible jealousy. The jealousy that you are feeling right now has no basis and will just affect your good relationship with your partner. In the aspect of Health and Spirituality, you need to improve your focus, cooperation, and determination. The energy of the card will just dissipate if you are losing your focus.",
    "love_meaning": "Misunderstandings may play a strong role now, with the reversed 8 of Wands tarot love meaning. Regardless of whether you’re single or attached, make sure to think carefully about what you say or do. If you are tempted to do something, anything - instead of waiting, you may want to reconsider. Instead of pushing forward, you may be better off giving the other person time, or at least making plans. If you’re attached, life may be hectic at this moment, making it easier for communication to get lost or confused between you and your partner. Give your lover the benefit of the doubt as the two of you go through this period, and make sure to continue communicating.",
    "career_meaning": "In this position, the eight of wands has two meanings that can apply to your career. Either you are not moving fast enough in your job or you have moved too quickly in the past. Take stock of how you feel. If you are frustrated by a sense of stagnation at work, this card can signal that you have missed opportunities by failing to act in time. You are not advancing because you let the opportunity to do so pass. If, however, you recently moved up in your career, it might be that you moved too quickly. This concern will manifest by feeling overwhelmed by what people are asking of you. If projects seem daunting, it might be useful to talk to someone about how they handle such tasks. You will learn to handle your new responsibilities, but it will take time and patience.",
    "finances_meaning": "The eight of wand here means that you are likely frustrated with the speed at which money is coming in. You might feel as if there is not enough or you should be having money flow in faster. The main take away from a card is that you should be more patient and remember that everything you are doing is part of your slow march towards progress. Your small investments today will pay off in the end (even if they are frustrating now). If your job does not pay as well as you would like, it might be that you are still paying your dues. One day you may have the job (and income) you desire, but you have to be patient today.",
    "as_feelings": "The appearance of the reversed Eight of Wands points to a sense of confusion or hesitation on their part. They may feel overwhelmed by their emotions and unable to express them clearly, leading to frustration or even a feeling of stagnation in your connection. This card indicates that they might be struggling with external pressures or distractions that prevent them from fully engaging with their feelings for you.\nWith regard to your own emotions, the reversed Eight of Wands reflects a similar sense of uncertainty. You could be feeling restless or impatient, yearning for progress but sensing delays that leave you questioning the direction of your relationship. This card encourages you to take a step back and reassess what truly matters, allowing yourself time to process these feelings rather than rushing into conclusions.",
    "as_actions": "With the reversed Eight of Wands in play, it’s time to hit the brakes and reassess your current path. Instead of rushing into decisions or actions, take a moment to reflect on what truly matters to you. This card encourages you to prioritize clarity over speed; consider journaling your thoughts or meditating to gain insight into your goals. You might also want to evaluate ongoing projects: are they aligned with your true desires? Focus on communication; reach out for feedback from trusted friends or mentors who can provide perspective. Embrace this pause as an opportunity for thoughtful planning rather than frantic movement.",
    "love": "misunderstandings, delays in love, hectic pace, confusion",
    "career": "career stagnation, lost chances, overwhelmed by job",
    "finances": "slow flow of money, lack of patience for financial growth"

  "abyss": "The geese are flying south for the winter in their classic “V” formation, sharing the burden by working together. The journey that began so long ago is now making significant headway. Still, there is not a moment to lose in their odyssey. The cold chill of winter edges them on, icing their very bones should they linger too long. They are pushed ever onward by their desire for freedom and their memories of greener climes. The Eight of Wands is all about speed, forward motion, and even possible travel. If projects have been stagnant for a while, know they will now start moving again. If you’ve been awaiting some pertinent news to come through, know it’s soon to arrive. Since the Eight of Wands is all about the active force of fire, you yourself might be feeling more energetic. Your project has now started to gather some steam. Keep it in motion by doubling down with renewed enthusiasm."
