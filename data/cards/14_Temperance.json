  "description": "On the Temperance card, there is an angel with wings, whose gender is not immediately obvious, which suggests that there is a balance between the sexes. One foot of the angel is in water, to represent the subconscious, while the other foot is on dry land, a representation of the material world. On her robe, there is a square, which has a triangle inscribed inside, another echo of the tangible earth in union with the holy trinity. She holds two cups in a manner where she can mix the waters, which represent the super and subconscious minds. The water flows between them, suggesting union and infinity.\nEverything about this card represents balance, the perfect harmony that comes from the union of dualities. Her advice is to test any new waters, before jumping into the deep end.",

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "Temperance in reversed is a reflection of something that is out of balance and may be causing stress and anxiety. The real meaning of the Temperance card can be deciphered using the other cards in the spread to identify areas where this imbalance is being caused. A Temperance in reversal may also be used as a warning; if you take a certain path, it would lead to turbulence and excess.\nLack of a long-term plan or vision may also be the Temperance reversal meaning. This creates a lack of purpose for you, leaving you feeling lopsided as you search here and there for what you should be doing. You must reflect and think carefully about what needs to change. Temperance reminds us that all things are only good in moderation, and that we must examine in which aspects of our lives we are breaking the balance.",
    "love_meaning": "In love, do you tend to think in all or nothing terms? Love, like many things in life, are full of grey areas. When reversed Temperance appears in a love tarot reading, your intensity may be surprising right now. Sometimes, no matter our best efforts, we can’t force love to come into being. You may benefit from being a bit more patient, while also making sure that your own emotions or desires do not go into extremes. When your date does something that is displeasing to you, do you tend to immediately reject them? Are you too demanding on your potential partners, so that nobody ever can satisfy you? It’s important to remember that humans can never be perfect; make sure your desires are reasonable.",
    "career_meaning": "Something at work may be suffering from a lack of balance right now. Do you tend to go all in when it comes to your work, so much so that other aspects of your life suffer? Are you always pulling all-nighters, hoping that it all pays off in the end? Or alternatively, do you find that you slack off, leading to resentment from your colleagues? While the former can bring you success, this can be damaging to you in the long term. If this applies to you, look to correct this imbalance. Ensure that when completing projects, you aren’t rushing through them or making reckless choices; the quality of your work may be suffering.",
    "finances_meaning": "Are you someone who always needs to buy yourself the next nice luxury? Or alternatively are you so frugal that you never reward your hard efforts with any small treat? It’s likely that both of these attitudes will need adjustment, as they are both untenable in the long term. The first always puts instant gratification over your future comfort, and vice versa. Consider your financial goals, and make sure you also put your own well-being in the picture; both your future well-being, and your present well-being needs to find a comfortable middle ground.",
    "as_feelings": "The appearance of the reversed Temperance card in relation to how someone feels about you points to a sense of imbalance and disharmony in their emotions. They may feel overwhelmed or conflicted, struggling to find a middle ground between their feelings for you and other aspects of their life. This could indicate that they are experiencing frustration or impatience, perhaps feeling that the connection lacks the harmony they desire.\nIn terms of your own feelings, this card reflects a similar struggle within yourself. You might be grappling with inner turmoil or uncertainty about what you truly want from this relationship. There is a chance that you're feeling disconnected from your own needs and desires, leading to confusion about how to move forward. It’s essential now to take time for self-reflection and seek balance within before making any decisions regarding this emotional landscape.",
    "as_actions": "With Temperance in reverse, it’s time to take a hard look at your life’s balance and harmony. It may be time to confront areas where you feel out of sync, whether it’s in relationships, work, or personal habits. Focus on integrating different aspects of your life rather than letting them clash. Take action by setting boundaries with others, prioritizing self-care routines like meditation or exercise, and exploring new hobbies that bring joy. Embrace a mindset shift; instead of seeking external validation, cultivate inner peace through mindfulness practices. This is your moment to realign with what truly nourishes your spirit.",

    "career": "work-life imbalance, all or nothing at job, rushed job, reckless decisions",

  "abyss": "Two elemental cups hold the key to inner balance. One holds the element of fire, its flames dancing and intertwining with the element of water, springing from the second cup. Together, through their fluid movements and acceptance of each other, they form the perfect balance of opposing forces. Fire is that inner creative drive that ignites us to move and act. Water, as our emotions, is sometimes turbulent, full of power to create or destroy. However, when brought together in the perfect blend of balance and harmony, they bring about stability, much as the forging and formation of new land when molten lava collides with the cool sea. The presence of the Temperance card in your spread is a call to moderation and harmonious relationships. If your reading is especially active in terms of events, this card urges you not to take extreme actions, but rather to take your time and not rush. Be calm and centered as the eye of the storm; ponder your responses. Certain situations may require you to compromise in order to reach a resolution. Don't allow yourself to be provoked; losing your temper will only push the process further from the balance and stability you seek."
