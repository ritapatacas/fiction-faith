    "overview": "Something isn’t quite right when the reversed 2 of Cups card shows up in a love tarot reading. Either the two of you are becoming too co-dependent on each other, unable to develop each person’s unique talents, or the balance between two partners can be upset with uneven power dynamics. If you’re in a relationship, always make sure to nurture your own and your partner’s individuality; the two of you are different people, with different interests and needs. Being who you are, on your own, will bring more to the relationship than if you were identical to your partner. Sometimes, this card can also point to the pursuit of love at the expense of all else.",

It is easy enough to compare how much you are earning with how much you are spending. It might be that you will have to take a closer look at the numbers and make some adjustments accordingly.

  "abyss": "A meaningful relationship can add color to our days and light to our nights. It can paint a once dreary sky in hues of vermilion and gold. The lovers depicted on the card have discovered such a relationship. They are locked in an intimate embrace; their bodies pulled close to each other, their serpentine tails interwoven. They breathe one breath; they speak with one voice. As interconnected as they are, however, they still remain two distinct beings with two separate bodies. At any given moment, one or the other could swiftly and effortlessly move away. They are interdependent, but not codependent. The serpentine tails of the two lovers are reminiscent of the caduceus. Known as Hermes' staff, the caduceus is an ancient symbol of healthy balance and negotiation. To keep their tender relationship fresh and vibrant, the young lovers will indeed have to rely heavily on these essential qualities. Should you receive the Two of Cups in your reading, know that there is a strong connection forming in your life. This relationship will go beyond simple romance or a quick romp. If you've had any issues within your current relationship, the Two of Cups speaks to reconciliation, or at the very least, a resolution of past issues."
