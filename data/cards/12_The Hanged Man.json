  "description": "In this card, it depicts a man who is suspended upside-down, and he is hanging by his foot from the living world tree. This tree is rooted deep down in the underworld, and it is known to support the heavens. It is believed that the hanging man is actually positioned there by his own free will. We believe this because of the serene expression which is on his face. His right foot is bound to the branches, but his left foot remains perfectly free. At the same time, he is holding his hands behind his back in a way which forms an inverted triangle. His wearing of red pants are a representation of the physical body and human’s passion, while the blue that he wears in his shirt are representative of calm emotions, a color combination that is commonly seen in saints. His intellect is symbolized by the yellow color of his shoes, hair and halo.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "The hanged man understands that his position is a sacrifice that he needed to make in order to progress forward - whether as repentance for past wrongdoings, or a calculated step backward to recalculate his path onward. This time he spends here will not be wasted, he does this as part of his progression forward. His upside down state can also symbolize the feeling of those that walk a spiritual path, for they see the world differently. Where there are others that do not understand the need to sacrifice, you see it differently. This is a natural course of action for you as you walk the path alone.\n\nThe Hanged Man card reflects a particular need to suspend certain action. As a result, this might indicate a certain period of indecision. This means that certain actions or decisions which need to be properly implemented are likely to be postponed even if there is an urgency to act at this particular moment. In fact, it would be ultimately the best if you are capable of stalling certain actions in order to ensure that you have more time to reflect on making critical decisions, this will ultimately be the best.\n\nThe Hanged Man card reflects a particular need to suspend certain action. As a result, this might indicate a certain period of indecision.\n\nThis is a card which is mainly designated towards waiting and suspension. This suggests that this might be the thing that you need to do in order to achieve success or to wait for the proper opportunity. Keep in mind that taking action is not always the best solution and in certain cases refraining from doing so might bring you just as much, if not more benefits.",
    "love_meaning": "In general, the Hanged Man is about sacrifice, new perspectives and waiting for the right time. For singles, the upright Hanged Man tarot love meaning indicates that things cannot be rushed. Regardless of how much you throw yourself into your romantic pursuits, or message your date all the right things, it may not be up to you if the other party isn’t ready. Instead of trying to force or pressure a relationship to come into fruition, use this time to see how your perspective changes when you’re alone. This same thing applies within relationships as well. Timing may be an issue when it comes to having important discussions, or taking your relationship to the next level.\nAlternatively, the concept of sacrifice may play an important role in your relationships, or potential relationships now. Help may be needed, and these can be moments in which your commitment is tested, but can also bring the two of you closer together.",
    "career_meaning": "When it comes to work, the Hanged Man can signal a feeling of waiting or uncertainty about what you should be doing. Your projects may be on pause, forcing you to take a break, or you may be waiting and contemplating what your next move is. There is a lesson to this card, which is that sometimes, no matter what, you cannot force a decision, or changes to occur when things are not at the right time. At times, you need to just wait, and the things that you were pushing for so hard, whether it’s a response from a business partner or colleague, or a decision from a client, or a decision on what to change in your career, will come in time. Relax, and just be. Alternatively, you may be in the process of making a big change in your career. What looks like taking a step backward may be a calculated process to realign your path with something that is more fulfilling to you.",
    "finances_meaning": "The Hanged Man can signal that a change in perspective is needed. If there has been some stress about money matters, you may find that at the moment a pause can actually bring you a new way of looking at things. Can you turn a bad situation into an opportunity? Do things only seem worse than they really are?",
    "as_feelings": "When you pull The Hanged Man in response to how someone feels about you, it reveals a deep sense of contemplation and surrender. This person is introspective, taking their time to explore the depths of their emotions toward you. They’re experiencing a shift in perspective, understanding that love demands patience and sacrifice. Their feelings aren’t rushed; they’re allowing themselves to view things from different angles before making any decisions.\nAs for your own feelings, The Hanged Man indicates you're facing uncertainty or a need for pause. You might feel suspended between action and reflection, questioning what truly matters in this relationship. Embrace this stillness; it offers valuable insights into your desires and needs as you move forward.",
    "as_actions": "With The Hanged Man at the forefront, now is the time for you to pause and reassess your current situation. This card encourages you to adopt a new perspective, urging you to let go of old habits or beliefs that no longer serve you. In practical terms, consider taking a break from your usual routine; perhaps spend some time in meditation or journaling to gain clarity on what truly matters. Engage in activities that promote mindfulness, like yoga or nature walks, allowing yourself the space to reflect deeply. Embrace this period of stillness as an opportunity for personal growth and transformation.",
    "love": "love can’t be rushed, avoid romantic pressure, sacrifice for love",
    "career": "uncertainty about career, waiting, forced break, thinking of next steps",
    "finances": "change in perspective about finances"
  },
  "reversed": {
    "overview": "The reversal meaning of the Hanged Man card represents a very specific period of time during which you feel as if you are sacrificing a significant amount of time while getting nothing in return. You might have felt as if certain things are at a state of an absolute standstill without any particular resolution or movement. It’s as if you are putting your entire effort and attention into something but nothing turns out as it should.",
    "love_meaning": "Now is the time for action. The reversed Hanged Man tarot love meaning suggests that the period of waiting is over. There may have been a slowdown in your love life recently, forcing you to take the time to consider different perspectives on romance and love. Ideally, you have re-emerged with a clearer understanding of what it is you expect from relationships. This may be a time when old, long held beliefs are being shed. With this new perspective, you are now equipped to take action or make changes in your romantic life with renewed energy. This card also can caution against making needless sacrifices for love. Make sure that your needs and your partner’s are balanced.",
    "career_meaning": "When the Hanged Man is reversed, you may feel that the sacrifices you’ve been making in your career haven’t really been yielding results. If you’ve recently changed career paths, or have taken time off to go through retraining, or used your family time for work projects, things may not be going as planned. It may not feel as if making these changes have been worth it. At times, this card can also indicate stalling for time. Instead of waiting for the right moment, you may be at such a loss about what to do next that you’ve been procrastinating on making a decision that will propel you to your next steps, leading to a feeling of powerlessness or stagnancy. Don’t languish too long, learn to be an active participant in your life.",
    "finances_meaning": "If you’ve been contemplating a major purchase or investment of your resources lately, your indecision and hesitancy may mean that you never take the next step. Sometimes, this card can also indicate that your investments are not yielding any returns; this doesn’t have to be in traditional banking institutions. Perhaps you lent money for a family member’s education, only to have them drop out. Perhaps you’ve put some of your finances into a side-hustle, only for it to be a failure. There is a sense of wasted sacrifice with this card; let these be a lesson for how to approach these situations in the future.",
    "as_feelings": "The arrival of the reversed Hanged Man suggests a sense of frustration and impatience. This person may feel stuck or unable to move forward in their emotions, leading them to question the connection between you. They might be grappling with conflicting feelings, unsure whether to take action or remain passive.\nWith regard to your own feelings, this card suggests that you are experiencing a desire for change but may feel trapped by circumstances or indecision. You could be yearning for clarity and direction while wrestling with doubts that keep you from fully embracing your emotions. It’s essential now to reflect on what truly matters to you and seek ways to liberate yourself from any self-imposed limitations.",
    "as_actions": "When you draw the reversed The Hanged Man, it’s a clear signal that change is on the horizon. You may have been feeling stuck or stagnant, but now is the moment to embrace change. Start by reassessing your current situation; identify what has been holding you back and let go of any limiting beliefs. Engage in activities that challenge your usual way of thinking, such as exploring new hobbies or seeking out diverse viewpoints through conversations with others. Prioritize taking small steps toward goals you've postponed, whether it's starting a project or making a necessary decision. Embrace this opportunity for growth and transformation.",
    "love": "new perspectives on love, changes in romantic life",
    "career": "new career move not working, procrastination, stalling for time",
    "finances": "indecision, failed investment, wasted financial sacrifice"
  },
  "abyss": "Suspended above the ground dangles the Hanged One. He is us and we are him. We see through his eyes and feel palpably his predicament. The world is askew, a dizzying rush of emotions and confusion. We are not accustomed to seeing the world from this perspective. Everything appears strange and yet new. How did the Hanged One get there? Was it his own doing? Or was it something inflicted upon him? We can't assume he's bound in any way, as we really can only see what's in front of him. Perhaps it's not as important how he got there, but rather how this situation has changed him and how his perception of the world has since changed. The road ahead of him ends near a home, with no one else in sight. No one, that is, except the two inquisitive ravens Huginn and Muninn, Odin's trusted messengers. They represent thought and mind. One of them holds a small branch in his beak as an offering. If the Hanged One appears in your reading, it offers you an opportunity to see things from a different perspective. This is the time when evolution will come about through stasis rather than action. The Hanged One brings a period of stillness or even possibly stagnation. It indicates a spiritual evolution achieved only through sacrifice or loss. It can augur a time of discomfort. Still, the discomfort is worth the price, as the reward will be greater than the sacrifice. In life, nothing of value is achieved without some form of sacrifice. Time, energy, comfort, and anything that you personally cleave to—can be temporarily affected. No matter the methods, transformation will occur."
