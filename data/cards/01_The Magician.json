  "description": "The Magician is one tarot card that is filled with symbolism. The central figure depicts someone with one hand pointed to the sky, while the other hand points to the ground, as if to say \"as above, so below\". This is a rather complicated phrase, but its summarization is that earth reflects heaven, the outer world reflects within, the microcosm reflects the macrocosm, earth reflects God. It can also be interpreted here that the magician symbolizes the ability to act as a go-between between the world above and the contemporary, human world.\n\nOn his table, the magician also wields all the suits of the tarot. This symbolizes the four elements being connected by this magician - the four elements being earth, water, air, and fire. The infinity sign on his head indicates the infinite possibilities of creation with the will.",

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "When you obtain the Magician reversed, it might mean its time for you to implement some changes. While right side up, the Magician represents true power, the reversed Magician is a master of illusion. The magic that he performs is one of deception and trickery. You may be lured in by the showmanship of his arts, but behind that there may be an intention to manipulate for selfish gain. Getting this card might mean that there is someone who pretends to have your best interests at hand when the opposite is true.\nConsider whether this reversed the magician is in your circle, or perhaps might also represent your current state of emotions. It may mean you may become obsessed with power and that might lead to wrong, reckless decisions that will lead to your eventual downfall.",

You may already feel this, but perhaps are too afraid to take the plunge, as it can be a risky move. You’ll need to take a closer look at what the real risks are, and understand whether your fears are truly grounded in reality, or whether they stem from a different source. Sometimes this card can also indicate that the people in your workplace may not be completely honest, or may have hidden agendas. If your gut instinct is telling you this, trust it; be wary about how much you share around them.",
    "finances_meaning": "If your finances aren’t quite what you hoped they would be right now, it may be that you’re not putting your best foot forward. You may have energy or talents that are being wasted, and you will only need to grow your confidence to put yourself out there. You may lack the willpower to transform your talents into money.

It’s essential to recognize these feelings and reclaim your personal power by focusing on clarity and intention in both yourself and your relationships.",
    "as_actions": "When you draw the reversed The Magician, it suggests that you may be feeling disconnected from your personal power and potential. It’s time to reassess how you approach your goals and intentions. Instead of trying to force outcomes, focus on clarity and authenticity in your actions. Consider simplifying your plans; break them down into manageable steps rather than overwhelming yourself with grand ideas. Engage in self-reflection by journaling or meditating to uncover what truly drives you.

  "abyss": "The Magician stands centered, his gaze steady and full of intent. This is no ordinary man; he is a blender of paths, one who grasps the heavens and yet is still rooted to Mother Earth. There are no barriers for him, since his world is boundless. The Magician harvests the energies of both earth and sky fusing them to his core. He is wise and knowing, his power a gift given freely from the Source of all. In this card, there are no human tools on hand. There is no elemental representation, since he himself holds all the elements within. Fire is at his core, the spiral energy he's harnessed. Air is within his mental capacity and ability to maintain the perfect balance. Water flows as his emotions, turning deep below his surface. And last but not least, Earth grounds him, his roots providing a constant connection to that which nourishes the body and all living things. There is great responsibility on the shoulders of the Magician. There may be no mistakes in maintaining this perfect elemental harmony. What we must always remember is that this type of understanding develops with time. As we strive to be like the Magician, we must first become aware of the powers we are aiming to balance. The Magician represents the symbiotic relationship between the conscious and the subconscious. He is capable of intelligently and lovingly controlling the forces of nature, and has access to the higher realms, thus unifying spirit and matter. When this card appears, it signals a time when we have the ability to will things into manifestation."
