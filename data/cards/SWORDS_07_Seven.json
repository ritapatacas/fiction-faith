  "description": "In the Seven of Swords card, there is a man that is seen running away sneakily from a camp of some sort, while carrying five swords in his hands. Behind him, two other swords are on standing on the ground. From this image, we can deduce that the Seven of Swords is about stealth, getting away with something, deception or betrayal.\nThe expression on the man’s face shows quite a bit of confidence, and he seems to be sure of his success on this mission of stealing the swords. Unfortunately for him though, on the left there seems to be a group of soldiers who have discovered the theft and one soldier is actually raising a flag or a weapon as if to signal his pursuit.",

    "overview": "The Seven of Swords in general, is said to be about betrayal and deception. When you get this card, it may imply that you or someone else in your life is having difficulty getting away with something. There are instances when we are forced to be sneaky, hoping that we will not be discovered. When we are found out, we have to face the consequences - whether it's embarrassment, punishment, or worse. Sometimes this happens when there are instances when you had to think on your feet, and did something that was somewhat shrewd and out of character. Now there is a danger of the secret coming out.\n\nThere are instances when we are forced to be sneaky, hoping that we will not be discovered. When we are found out, we have to face the consequences.\n\nYou may be tempted to sneak away from somewhere, indicating a situation that is no longer working as expected. Instead of dealing with it, you choose to sneak away and hope that you will go unnoticed. Perhaps you were hoping that this issue would just resolve itself over time, and you've neglected it - leaving it to only grow and get worse.\n\nThe big question, when looking at the Seven of Swords, is whether escaping will solve this problem that you are facing. While you might be thinking that you have gotten away, you discover that the situation has cornered you and you are found out as you are trying to escape.\nThere are instances when the Seven of Swords may indicate the willingness to go solo. You may have the urge to explore and discover some things on your own. This can be an effective approach if you want to assert your independence and bypass group agreement. The Seven of Swords symbolism may be encouraging you to go on this path; sometimes innovation comes from a rogue genius.",
    "love_meaning": "Lies and tricks may be abound with the 7 of Swords tarot love meaning. It may be important for you right now to remain cautious, especially if you’ve met someone new. You or someone in your romantic life can be dishonest right now, and in the worst possible cases, even unfaithful. If your instincts have been telling you that you are being lied to, you may need to confront this and have an honest discussion. If this has been you, consider the long term consequences of your actions. Even the kindest lie to spare feelings can grow into big problems should the root cause not be addressed.

You may be dealing with colleagues attempting to sabotage you with gossip, badmouthing you to bosses, or attempting to take credit for your work. Be cautious about who you trust in this situation; it may come from where you least expect it. Sometimes, this card can also suggest you will need a certain degree of strategy to accomplish your projects.

    "as_feelings": "The Seven of Swords reveals a landscape of cunning and strategy. This person feels conflicted, perhaps even guarded in their emotions. They admire your intelligence and independence but hesitate to show vulnerability, approaching their feelings with caution. An underlying tension simmers as they wrestle with trust issues or past experiences that hold them back from fully opening up.\nYour own feelings echo this complexity. The Seven of Swords signals a yearning for freedom and authenticity. You might be wrestling with honesty and self-protection, torn between the desire for connection and the fear of betrayal. This card urges you to reflect on whether you're being true to yourself amid these swirling emotions, guiding you toward clarity amidst confusion or doubt.",

    "career_meaning": "Truths are coming to light now, and if others have been acting untruthfully now, their lies can be exposed. Whether you’re the victim of this deceit, or you’re the one that has been unfair, guilt and shame is likely to push the perpetrator to confession and perhaps reconciliation. As long as you make amends, and face the consequences, there is likely to be forgiveness. Alternatively, the situation at work can escalate; sometimes those who are at fault are not brought publically to justice. Keep in mind, that however disappointing, one’s character will dictate their fate in the future. Sometimes the 7 of Swords is a simple statement that the strategies and the approach you’re using at work is just not working, and you’ll have to change how you handle your projects.",
    "finances_meaning": "Have you been completely honest in your financial dealings? Now may be a good time to get your taxes paid, and in order before you get in deeper trouble. Or have you been a victim of theft, scams or fraud? The truth is coming to light now and there can be consequences for those that have not walked an honorable path.",
    "as_feelings": "With the reversed Seven of Swords at play, you’re witnessing a powerful transformation towards honesty and transparency in how this person feels about you. They may have previously harbored doubts or insecurities, but now they are beginning to recognize the importance of trust and open communication. This newfound clarity suggests that they want to be genuine with you, shedding any previous deceit or hidden agendas.\nThe arrival of this card suggests a moment to confront any self-deception or avoidance you've been experiencing regarding your own feelings. You might feel an urge to embrace vulnerability and authenticity within yourself, realizing that true connection requires letting go of past fears. Embrace this opportunity for growth as you navigate both your emotions and the evolving dynamics between you two.",
    "as_actions": "As the Seven of Swords reveals itself, now is the time to embrace honesty and transparency in your actions. You may have been avoiding difficult conversations or sidestepping responsibilities, but it’s crucial to confront these issues head-on. Reassess any areas where you might be deceiving yourself or others, and commit to being forthright in your dealings. This could mean having an open dialogue with a colleague about shared tasks or addressing unresolved conflicts in personal relationships. By choosing integrity over evasion, you will foster trust and create stronger connections while paving the way for genuine progress in your life."

  "abyss": "In general, the Seven of Swords is all about hidden dishonor. For this reason, I chose an image that shows the idea of a person who is more or less suspicious. A man is lurking in the dark, with one hand on a dagger and with the other turning a door handle. We don't really know if he's sneaking off or trying to break in. Regardless, he appears to have some ill-intended plans. There is a sense of deception and mistrust in his demeanor. When the Seven of Swords shows up in a reading it is worthwhile examining the situation from multiple angles. If we read the card as someone sneaking off, it might indicate an attempt to avoid some obligation or commitment. Ask yourself if this is something that is going on with you, or someone else in your sphere. Another possibility is to see the card as someone breaking in. With this interpretation comes deception, manipulation, or even in some cases an actual theft of some sort. Similar to the Five of Swords, the Seven of Swords deals with ethics or the lack thereof. Are you feeling guilty over something that you have done or are thinking of doing? If you have a clear conscience, examine your surroundings to make sure no one is trying to exploit you or tarnish your hard-earned reputation."
