  "description": "Much like the other court cards of this suit, the Knight of Pentacles revolves around work, effort, and a general responsibility. The Knight of Pentacles sits on a dark horse in a field. Unlike the other knights, who are always off on one adventure or another, this knight decides to stay home, and instead, focus on tilling the fields. He prepares for the next harvest - it is on this land that he believes that he can do the most. In his hands, he has a single gold coin. He gazes into it, and in his eyes we see a careful consideration. Perhaps he is dreaming of what it could bring him. The other knights may think he's a little boring, but this knight is more concerned about the long term future of his kingdom.",
