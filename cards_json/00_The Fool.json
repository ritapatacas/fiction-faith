  "description": "The Fool depicts a youth walking joyfully into the world. He is taking his first steps, and he is exuberant, joyful, excited. He carries nothing with him except a small sack, caring nothing for the possible dangers that lie in his path. Indeed, he is soon to encounter the first of these possible dangers, for if he takes just a step more, he he topple over the cliff that he is reaching. But this doesn't seem to concern him - we are unsure whether he is just naive or simply unaware. The dog at his heels barks at him in warning, and if he does not become more aware of his surroundings soon, he may never see all the adventures that he dreams of encountering.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "The Fool card is numbered 0, which is considered to be a number of infinite potential. Consider him a blank slate, for The Fool has yet to develop a clear personality. He is the symbol of innocence - his journey to come will shape his character yet.\n\nTo see the The Fool generally means a beginning of a new journey, one where you will be filled with optimism and freedom from the usual constraints in life. When we meet him, he approaches each day as an adventure, in an almost childish way. He believes that anything can happen in life and there are many opportunities that are lying out there, in the world, waiting to be explored and developed. He leads a simple life, having no worries, and does not seem troubled by the fact that he cannot tell what he will encounter ahead.\n\nHe inspires courage, for he understands that every day is a chance to open up new areas in your life, and with that comes a mixture of anticipation, wonder, awe and curiosity.\n\nTo meet him in a reading can also be seen as a call to the risk-taking part of your own character. He inspires courage, for he understands that every day is a chance to open up new areas in your life, and with that comes a mixture of anticipation, wonder, awe and curiosity. The Fool is there to show that you can never really tell what lies ahead, and you can only greet it with joy.",

    "overview": "When you land on the reversed Fool in your reading, you can generally find his more negative characteristics being on display. It can mean that you are literally acting like a fool by disregarding the repercussions of your actions. Like the youth depicted in the card, you don't see how dangerous of a position you find yourself in.\nA reversed Fool card can show that you are living in the moment and not planning for the future. The reversed Fool meaning serves as caution that you should be more aware so as not to be taken advantage of. Like the dog in the Rider Waite version, this card is here to alert you on anything that may sound too good to be true.",
    "love_meaning": null,
    "career_meaning": "You may have all the energy in the world, and eagerness to do use that energy, however, you may not quite have the insight to do so without any consequences. Try and be more aware about how your actions affect your colleagues right now, and think before you take action. Other times, the reversed Fool can signal that your current job feels stale and boring, and you may be feeling like it’s time for a change. Sometimes, this indicates that you may feel blocked from actually doing so, or that you need to consider these plans very carefully before making that choice. It may be that there are more dangers than you see right now.",
    "finances_meaning": "When it comes to your finances, the reversed Fool can suggest financial opportunities, but beware of recklessness. This means that you’ll have to do your research before you lay down your dollars, and there can be consequences that you are not yet aware of. This period can also spell out being careless about your financial decisions; all your impulse purchases are adding up to more than you can actually afford, so you’ll need to take a closer and more realistic look at your bank account.",
    "as_feelings": "The arrival of the reversed Fool suggests a sense of hesitation and uncertainty in how this person feels about you. They may be feeling overwhelmed by their own fears or insecurities, leading them to hold back from fully embracing the connection. Their feelings are clouded by doubt, making them question whether they should take a leap of faith with you or remain cautious and guarded.\nYou might feel that the reversed Fool reflects your own emotions as well, indicating that you could be grappling with similar feelings of apprehension. You could be wrestling with indecision about moving forward in this relationship, fearing potential risks or consequences. This card encourages you to confront these anxieties and consider what truly holds you back from experiencing joy and spontaneity in love.",
    "as_actions": "When you draw The Fool reversed, it’s a signal to take a step back and evaluate your journey. You may be rushing into new experiences without fully considering their implications. Instead, focus on grounding yourself by evaluating your goals and intentions. Take a moment to reflect on what truly excites you and whether those pursuits align with your values. In practical terms, this could mean journaling about your aspirations or seeking advice from trusted mentors. Embrace a more cautious approach; consider taking small steps toward change rather than leaping into the unknown without preparation or thoughtfulness.",
    "love": "lack of commitment, risky relationship",
    "career": "stale and boring job, reckless actions at work",
    "finances": "caution around financial opportunities, foolish purchases"

  "abyss": "The Fool is someone who is not ashamed to explore her dreams. She will venture off into the unknown, regardless of what people say or think about her. She is not scared, although perhaps a little bit of fear would do her good in some cases. The Fool is the inner child who so eagerly tries to escape, to be fresh and full of hope and not stifled by the conditioning that society and the world places upon us. The Fool will step off the cliff and know that, somehow, her feet will sprout wings and lift her to her destination. In Tarot of the Abyss, the Fool is within her element; she is carefree, her hair is long and untamed like tentacles as it expands and reaches for the Sun. Her expression is serene, as she places one foot over the edge of the cliff, and casts aside the rose that she has carried from the beginning of her journey, a symbol of the world she's left behind. She closes her eyes, as if to avoid the evidence of any potential threat that she might encounter. Perhaps the wind is bringing warnings of an impending storm. Perhaps there are other paths that she should take to get to her destination. Regardless, the one she is on now will be full of adventures. Below, the bright rays of light tell us something is below, we just don't know what that is yet. In the distance, no birds fly; free, just as the Fool, coming or going at their pleasure. When the Fool appears in your reading, something new is on the horizon. You're on the verge of a new adventure that will require you to take a leap of faith. While this is generally a positive card, it is still a good idea to look before you leap. Enjoy the ride, for a time of new beginnings and adventures awaits."
