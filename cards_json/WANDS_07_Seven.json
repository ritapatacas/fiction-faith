  "abyss": "This is one of my favorite cards of the Suit of Wands. For me, it symbolizes that regardless of the challenges facing us, we have the courage and strength we need to stand our ground. The image shows a man surrounded by several spears. Though he is obviously outnumbered, he bears absolutely no sign of fear, neither in his facial expressions nor his posture. He stands strong, utterly focused on defending himself at all costs. He accepts and embraces the battle. He is not one who will go down without a fight. And notice that he holds the high ground; though he has several foes, there are still forces working in his favor. When the Seven of Wands presents itself in your spread, it augurs a period that will require you to stand your ground and defend your position. The forces arranged against you are not insignificant; you may feel as if you are being attacked from all sides. However, just as the man in the card, you possess the inner drive and determination, the courage and stamina to beat back your attackers. The battle will not be easy, but look to your inner fortitude, your outer aptitude, and any natural advantages you can exploit to fight your way through."
