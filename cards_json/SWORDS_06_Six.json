  "description": "The image in the Six of Swords shows a woman and a child in a boat being rowed in the water to a land that is on the other side. We can gather from the images that the woman and the child are leaving something behind, as their backs are faced towards us. The woman's head is covered with a cloak - perhaps she is fleeing something, and must go without others knowing her true identity. We can assume that because of this, she is undergoing great loss or sadness. The symbolism within the Six of Swords is that of loss or change, as well as moving towards a future that looks more promising than the one that we left behind. The six swords alongside the boat symbolize the strong power of the rational mind, compared to intuition and the heart.",

This transition will most likely be the result of decisions you made in the past, and now they are forcing you to leave something behind in order to move forward. Despite your sadness, you need to remember that moving on is the ideal option for your future.\n\nDespite your sadness, you need to remember that moving on is the ideal option for your future.\n\nLife is filled with moments when you are going to be forced into letting go of things that you have become attached to.

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "What do you find hard to let go of? The reversed 6 of Swords tarot love meaning suggests that the past still has a strong hold on you, despite your attempts to leave it behind. On one hand, you may know that leaving the past is something that is the healthiest for you to do, but you may be compulsively pulled back.

Examine what binds you, and also consider what potential happy future you are willing to sacrifice for its sake.",

    "career_meaning": "It seems that no matter what you do, you can’t escape your work troubles. Your workplace may be filled with stress, fights and conflicts that are draining and take a toll on your mental health. Even though you may want to leave, it seems like you are trapped in this job, and at the moment can’t find anything better. Sometimes, this card can also suggest that you may be the one creating the trouble; instead of letting things go, you may be returning to the same issues over and over again, holding grudges despite another party’s willingness to put things behind them. It’s likely that you may want to look at your own attitude and defensiveness and see whether that is contributing to your own stress levels. What can you let go of? If you do manage to leave this job, be wary that the same problems arise again. We can run away from an environment, from people; but not ourselves.",
    "finances_meaning": "Are you trying to escape your financial problems right now? When it comes to money issues, it’s generally not possible to escape them. The only thing you can do is confront them face to face and deal with them honestly and calmly. What seems insurmountable may seem much simpler to face once you’ve done the work of actually accepting your situation. If you need it, search for a professional that can help you with your situation.",
    "as_feelings": "When you draw the reversed Six of Swords in a reading about how someone feels about you, it suggests that this person is grappling with confusion and emotional turmoil. They may feel stuck or unable to move forward in their feelings for you, perhaps haunted by past experiences or unresolved issues. Their emotions are clouded by uncertainty, making it difficult for them to fully embrace what they might want from your connection.\nThis card surfaces when it’s time to reflect on your own feelings, indicating that you might be experiencing similar turbulence. You could feel trapped in negative thoughts or memories that prevent you from seeing the potential for growth and healing within yourself. This card encourages you to confront these feelings head-on and seek clarity so that both your emotional landscape and any relationship dynamics can shift toward a more positive direction.",
    "as_actions": "You might sense a call to confront unresolved issues rather than sidestepping them. This card indicates a need to reassess your current situation and recognize any emotional baggage you're carrying. Instead of seeking escape, take time for self-reflection and identify what truly holds you back. Engage in open conversations with those around you to clear misunderstandings or lingering tensions. Consider journaling your thoughts or feelings to gain clarity on your journey ahead. Embrace this opportunity for growth by facing challenges head-on, allowing yourself to heal and move forward with renewed strength and purpose."

  "abyss": "The mother holds her child close, yet her gaze is focused forward, unwavering. She flies through the sky on the wise, knowing raven. Below, the turbulent waters rage on, ready to engulf them in an instant should they lose their grip. The raven is strong; its wingspan spans the skies. Like an arching arrow, it's aimed high, avoiding the grave dangers below. There is a definite sense of movement in this card; things are progressing and certainly not standing still. The Six of Swords is a card all about moving forward. If you've had any health issues in the past, you may start to see a turnaround in that regard. This is not a card that promises perfection, but it does signal a beginning. Your frame of mind is changing, and with that, positive changes or perhaps even physical moves are on the horizon. Perhaps a trip approaches. The Six of Swords reminds you to leave the stress of the situation behind through this transition. In the process, peace of mind will follow. Old patterns of thinking are no longer useful and will only drag you down."
