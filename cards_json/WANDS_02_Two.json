  "abyss": "A merchant peers out into the distance. His facial expressions and clothing are rugged and shrewd; he is not one to be trifled with. He appears to be deeply concentrating and far thinking. Perhaps he is planning his strategy, or considering the potential pitfalls he will have to guard against to bring his plan to fruition. From his many years of experience, he knows that the success or failure of his plan depends heavily on how carefully he lays out his strategy, how detail-oriented he is, and how well he anticipates and guards against the inevitable challenges his plan will face.
