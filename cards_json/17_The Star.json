  "description": "The Star card shows a woman kneeling at the edge of a small pond. She is holding two containers of water. One container pours the water out to the dry land, as if to to nourish it and ensure its fertility. The lush green land around her seems to say that it is working. One foot is inside the water which shows the spiritual abilities and inner strength of the woman. The other foot on the ground shows her practical abilities and strengths. Behind her, there is a large central star surrounded by seven small stars which represent the chakras. There is bird standing at a tree branch which represents the holy ibis of thought. The Star's astrological correspondent is Aquarius.",

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "When the Star card is reversed, it means that you are feeling as though everything has turned against you. The challenges that you would normally see as exciting seem instead to make you feel as though you cannot overcome them. You have lost faith in something, whether inside yourself or with something you normally find dear.\n\nWithout hope, without faith, we cannot find the motivation to progress forward in the challenges that we face. Where in your life are you feeling hopeless? In what ways do you already feel defeated? And how does that affect your actions? The star reversed asks us to nurture our sense of hope and positive energy to help propel our actions with joy instead of fear.",
    "love_meaning": "Self doubt and a loss of faith is clouding your judgement with the reversed Star’s appearance. Are you suffering from a loss of confidence? Do you pick at your own flaws with excessive harshness? What is making you feel unworthy of love? Others can sense this with you, and this can make you feel even worse while reinforcing your negative feelings about yourself. It is important now to remember all the wonderful things about yourself, so that you can see yourself as a worthy partner.\nThe doubt and loss of faith can also apply not just to yourself, but also to your feelings about love in general. If you have been single for a while, cynicism may make you believe that love only creates pain, or is an illusion that is not worth pursuing, when it is actually an attitude problem that pushes others away.",
    "career_meaning": "With the reversed Star, it may be likely that your negativity is having an effect on your work. You may no longer feel enthusiastic or creative, because you can only see things in a pessimistic manner. Have your hopes not panned out? Have you given up faith that things can get better? When we despair, we make a bad situation worse, and the will to keep going can be snuffed out. It is likely that though things may be tense right now, it isn’t as bad as you seem to make of it. A change in your approach, perspective or attitude may be all that is needed in order to give you motivation to make positive changes.",
    "finances_meaning": "If you have been struggling with finances, the reversed Star can suggest that not all hope is lost, but you may have already given up. There are likely things you can still do now to change your situation, but only if you can muster up the positivity to see things in a new light, and take action. Opening your heart to a more positive outlook can also open your eyes to opportunity.",
    "as_feelings": "When the reversed Star card appears in relation to how someone feels about you, it suggests a sense of disillusionment or disappointment. This person may feel uncertain and lack hope regarding your connection, possibly due to past experiences that have left them feeling vulnerable or let down. They might be struggling with their own insecurities, which clouds their ability to see the potential for positivity between you.\nAs you navigate your feelings, the reversed Star indicates that you could be grappling with self-doubt and a loss of faith in yourself or your situation. You may find it challenging to envision a brighter future or feel disconnected from your aspirations. It’s essential to acknowledge these emotions and seek ways to restore hope within yourself while recognizing that healing is possible through self-reflection and nurturing your inner light.",
    "as_actions": "Guided by The Star reversed, you need to shift your perspective and reconnect with your inner self. It may be time to confront feelings of hopelessness or disillusionment, urging you to take action towards healing and renewal. Focus on nurturing your mental well-being by engaging in activities that inspire creativity, such as journaling or painting. Consider setting aside moments for meditation or quiet reflection to regain clarity about your aspirations. Additionally, reach out for support from trusted friends or mentors who can help guide you back toward a more optimistic outlook on life. Embrace this opportunity for personal growth and transformation.",
    "love": "extreme self-criticism, loss of hope about romance, lack of confidence",
    "career": "lack of motivation, lack of enthusiasm, pessimism about work",

  "abyss": "The journey was long and arduous, and through it all, the wanderer has encountered many obstacles and setbacks. Still, her inner drive has proven resolute and has never waned. Throughout her journey, she has relied on a constant presence that has guided her home—the North Star. It is ever present, ever faithful, a silent friend in the endless sky. The Star nourishes her and feeds her hope. Now, safe at last from the perils that once threatened her very existence, she reaches out in gratitude. The Star card is a symbol of hope. It is fitting that it follows the Tower, as even when all hope appears lost, the Star shines forth, reminding us with its beacons of light and warmth that a new day will soon follow. If there have been any major changes in your life recently that have threatened to throw you off course, the Star card is here to provide you a sense of peace and security. Have faith in what the future will bring and try not to dwell on the problems of the past. There is something that stills the mind when we look at a night sky; it helps us put things into perspective. Time and experience have made you more resilient and capable."
