  "description": "There is a quiet stillness that is present in the Four of Swords, a sense of calm peace that is contrasted so deeply with the pain in the Three of Swords. Here, in a church, there is a carving of a knight that lies upon a tomb with three swords hanging above him while the fourth one lies beneath him. These three swords are a reminder of the suffering that he has endured in the earlier card. The position of the fourth sword seems to be a signal that the fight has ended. A child and a woman are depicted by the stained glass place behind the statue, giving the scene a sense of warmth and welcoming after the retreat. The knight has his hands positioned as if he is praying.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "After the time of chaos, anger and pain depicted in the Three of Swords, the Four of Swords can signal that it is time to retreat. The Four of Swords is a moment of rest. Whether this is from a choice to withdraw, or whether it is from pure exhaustion, it is not clear. We are still tender from the wounds that were inflicted, and the battle weapons still hang above us as a grim reminder of what was lost. In order to continue and re-emerge in your daily life, you must take the time now to take a breather. There is always the faint fear that something more is bound to happen again and it is advisable that you take all chances to rest.\n\nThe Four of Swords is a moment of rest. Whether this is from a choice to withdraw, or whether it is from pure exhaustion, it is not clear.\n\nYou need to gain strength and clarity in a quiet environment away from your current circumstances. It is time to re-evaluate, organize and understand your priorities. This helps to rejuvenate one’s spirit, and you come out stronger than before.\nThe Four of Swords indicates it is time to gather new strength and prepare to face a new challenge. You have faced crisis after crisis, and it is wearing you out. You can face a new challenge only after getting away from everything and embracing a new atmosphere.\n\nTake the time to nurture yourself to re-enter life. Within us glimmers hope, and it lies quietly, waiting to reveal itself after we are healed anew.",
    "love_meaning": "With the 4 of Swords tarot love meaning, some time to rest is in order. If you’re single, your excitement about your love life may have led you to push yourself to exhaustion. You may be trying too hard to impress someone, or have been dating someone new every day in order to find someone you truly want to be with. You may feel drained, and it is important to listen to your intuition and your body to take it easy for a bit. If you’re already in a relationship, you can both benefit from taking a vacation. Sometimes, this card can also indicate the two of you needing to be alone for a while; this doesn’t spell the end of the relationship, but everyone, perhaps especially introverts, need some personal time.",
    "career_meaning": "Work may have been very busy or frustrating lately. You may have been putting in your all for a long time now, and chronic stress may be taking a toll on your body or mental health. Listen to your body, and give yourself a break. If you can, take a mental health day, and spend it caring for yourself or catching up on sleep. None of us are machines, and without some much needed rest, the effect it takes on our health can be long lasting. You can return with a refreshed mind after.",
    "finances_meaning": "Does your mind run around in circles worrying about what you have in your bank? If you’re used to dealing with financial stress, thinking (or rather, worrying) about your finances can be second nature. Try and give your mind a break. Oftentimes, letting a thought go around in circles solves nothing, and the best thing we can do for our minds is think of something else. Avoid letting paranoid ideas and negative thinking consume you.",
    "as_feelings": "The Four of Swords signals a crucial moment for pause and reflection on how someone feels about you. They’re taking time to sort through their emotions, showing they aren’t rushing into feelings or decisions about your relationship. This person values peace and mental clarity, indicating they appreciate the connection but need space to process their thoughts before fully engaging.\nAs for your own feelings, this card prompts you to embrace a period of rest and recovery. You may crave solitude or feel overwhelmed by outside pressures. It urges you to step back and recharge emotionally, allowing for deeper self-reflection so you can grasp what truly matters in this situation.",
    "as_actions": "In the realm of self-care, drawing the upright Four of Swords suggests that now is a time for rest and reflection. You should prioritize self-care and create space for mental rejuvenation. This may mean stepping back from your daily hustle to recharge, perhaps by dedicating quiet moments to meditation or journaling your thoughts. Consider decluttering your environment as a way to clear your mind, allowing new perspectives to emerge. Engage in activities that promote relaxation, like taking long walks in nature or practicing yoga. Embrace this period of stillness; it will help you gain clarity on what truly matters and prepare you for future challenges with renewed energy.",
    "love": "withdrawing from love life, alone time, taking a break",
    "career": "taking a vacation, mental health day, rest, self-care",
    "finances": "anxiety about finances, avoid overthinking about money"

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "If you haven’t heeded the warnings of giving yourself some rest, the reversed 4 of Swords tarot love meaning can signal that you won’t have a choice. If you’ve been chasing a potential lover relentlessly, you may find that your advances are now feeling unwelcome. You may benefit from giving this person time and space to make their own choice. Pressuring someone often creates the opposite effect of the one you desire. Alternatively, this card can also indicate coming out of a period of rest. You may feel more energized than ever! Couples who have felt that their relationship was getting a little too routine can find that their passions are reigniting.",

    "career_meaning": "You may have given yourself a much needed little break from work, but you may now be feeling ready to return. Ideally, you’ll have used this time away to reduce your stress, and take some much needed care for yourself. With a refreshed and rejuvenated time away, you’re likely to find that situations that have caused you suffering and frustration before are a bit easier to handle. Try and be more aware of your stress levels from here on out. Sometimes however, this card can also signal continuing work despite needing rest. If this has been the case for you, you may want to reconsider. Our bodies will often force us to take a break. You may also want to consider changing jobs, if the situation truly looks like it won’t improve.",
    "finances_meaning": "Your financial situation may be improving, and you may be recovering from a period of intense pressure. Perhaps bills are being paid, debts have been paid down, or expenses may be decreasing. Alternatively, pressure may be increasing, and you may start feeling overwhelmed with bills. Search for support; there may be people that can help you at this time. At times, this card can also suggest that you may not be accepting financial support despite having it.",
    "as_feelings": "When you draw the reversed Four of Swords, it suggests that this person is experiencing restlessness and perhaps even anxiety regarding their emotions. They may feel overwhelmed by their thoughts and are struggling to find clarity. This could indicate that they are not at peace with their feelings for you, leading to confusion or indecision.\nThis card carries an invitation to confront any underlying anxieties within yourself. You might be feeling restless yourself, yearning for action rather than retreating into contemplation. This card encourages you to confront any underlying anxieties and seek resolution instead of remaining stuck in uncertainty. Embrace this moment as an opportunity for growth and understanding in both your emotional landscape and your connection with them.",
    "as_actions": "In the presence of the Four of Swords reversed, it’s time to take action rather than retreat. You may have been in a period of rest or contemplation, but now is the moment to re-engage with life and confront any unresolved issues. Shift your perspective by viewing challenges as opportunities for growth. Start by reaching out to someone you’ve distanced yourself from; open communication can lead to healing. Additionally, consider setting small goals that push you out of your comfort zone, whether it's joining a new class or tackling a project you've been avoiding. Embrace movement and connection; it’s time to awaken your spirit and reclaim your energy."

  "abyss": "The Four of Swords is a good omen. The time has come for quiet preparation and retreat from the daily grind. It's a welcome and much needed respite that perhaps we've been putting off for a while. Often, the best way to get relief from stress is to take the time to listen to your body. Heed the small voice that's calling you to consolidate your energy. We're so used to being in motion, to keeping active whether it's in a job or at home, that we tend to forget that we are not invincible. Shifting our focus, cares and woes from the external world to the needs and wants of our inner world is important if any type of healing is to take place."
