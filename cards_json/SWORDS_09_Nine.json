  "description": "The Nine of Swords depicts a woman that is sitting on her bed while she holds her head in her hands. It appears as though the woman has just awakened from a very bad nightmare. She seems to be upset, anxious and fearful. Nine swords are hanging on her wall, and a carving that depicts a person defeated by another can be found in her bed. The quilt has been decorated with various astrological symbols and roses. Here we see the same woman in that we saw earlier in the Eight of Swords - and perhaps, she was finally released, but haunted by the nightmares of the suffering she endured while she was left and deserted.",

    "overview": "The Nine of Swords is often associated with fear and anxiety, about all the things that worry you and keep you up at night. Sometimes this card can be associated with trauma - one which may be shameful for you to confide with others about, and all the psychological responses that come from experiencing that trauma.\n\nSometimes this card can be associated with trauma - one which may be shameful for you to confide with others about\n\nWhen we are never released from the entrapment depicted in the Eight of Swords, we escalate into the Nine of Swords, where we are plagued by nightmares. The suit of swords is one that is concerned with the mind, with logic, with intelligence, and with communication, but somehow the Nine of Swords was caught on the destructive end of the mind, the one which turns inward on itself, multiplies and festers. Questions are plaguing you, and you find yourself reciting all the possibilities - all the things that can happen to you. You are haunted by what could be.\n\nThere is a sense of repetition within this card, that some event which has troubled you before, and one which you managed to either repress or run away from, is coming back again. Sharing your grief does at least provide an outlet for your pain and may release you from carrying this burden alone. Is there anyone that you can feel comfortable speaking to?\n\nSharing your grief does at least provide an outlet for your pain and may release you from carrying this burden alone.\n\nIn cases where it is less about trauma and more about general anxiety, analyze yourself and think if this is a feeling that is within your control or if there are other factors that contribute to your anxiety. Concentrate on the matters which you can control, and learn to ask for help.",

  "abyss": "This is the card of nightmares and unfounded fears. We all have been there, struggling to deal with the anxieties that bubble up unrelentingly from our subconscious. Our nightmares can leave us so terrified that we are afraid to go back to sleep. Even worse, we may actually start to believe that there is some truth to them—is it a warning, perhaps? The Nine of Swords depicts that moment when we are imprisoned within a dream world, a world so vivid that we actually believe it to be real. Yet, we all know that the woman will awaken and realize that it was simply a bad dream. She is in no real danger, and she still has ample opportunity to shape her reality in the here and now. Are you feeling worried or overwhelmed? Drawing the Nine of Swords tells you that you're making yourself sick with worry. Your thoughts are whirling round and round, provoking anxiety and destroying your resting hours. While the Three of Swords represents external sorrow, the Nine of Swords speaks to internal despair. Imagining the worst is not the way to go. Our fears are very often unfounded and even if they have basis in reality, worry and anxiety only compound the situation, making a solution more elusive. Seek stillness; discover your inner peace through prayer and meditation, and take one moment at a time."
