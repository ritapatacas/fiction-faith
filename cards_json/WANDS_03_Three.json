  "abyss": "The Three of Wands shows the same merchant from the Two of Wands standing on a dock, his gaze fixed on a sailing ship. If you examine the card carefully, you will realize that it is possible to regard the ship from two distinct vantage points: from one point of view, it appears to be arriving. On the other hand, it can also be perceived as setting sail. We aren’t sure if the ship is coming or going, but what is very clear is that the merchant is deeply concentrating on its activity. His back is turned away from the viewer and towards the ship, towards his goal. In the Ace of Wands, inspiration and creativity won the day. Then, in the Two of Wands, planning and preparation prevailed. Here, in the Three of Wands, it is time to put those carefully laid plans into action. The ship in the card could even indicate the need for travel in connection with your plan. Regardless, one thing is clear: the time has come to actively implement your plan. Rely on your energy, enthusiasm, and careful planning to launch your ideas in the here and now."
