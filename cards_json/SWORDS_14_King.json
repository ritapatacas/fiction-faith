    "career_meaning": "Your workplace may not be a very pleasant place to be right now. The reversed King of Swords signals a person at your job who is dominating, aggressive, and power-hungry. They may be in a place of power, and they can use that power for all the wrong reasons. If this doesn’t represent a person in your workplace, you may have to take a closer look at your own behavior. You may find that it is easier to lose your cool, and fail to act with as much integrity or logic as you usually do. At this time, you may also be suffering from lack of self-discipline; not just losing your cool, but your motivation and energy.",
    "finances_meaning": "You may not have been very disciplined with your finances lately, and have overspent, purchased many useless things, or have invested in things that are not producing returns for you.

It encourages you to seek inner truth and regain mental balance so that you can navigate these complex feelings more effectively.",
    "as_actions": "As the King of Swords appears in reverse, it’s time to reconsider your approach to decision-making. This is a call to reassess how you communicate and connect with others, as your current approach may be too harsh or overly analytical. Focus on listening more than speaking; engage in conversations where empathy takes precedence over logic. In practical terms, consider journaling to clarify your thoughts or seeking feedback from trusted friends about your communication style.

  "abyss": "He stands alone atop a craggy cliff, perched above the maze of the mind. He has attained an even higher form of knowledge and wisdom, his intuition. He has learned to balance the directions of his mind against the compass of his heart, and the result is a pure and majestic form of leadership. In his right hand, he leans upon the Sword of Truth, and he knows well how to wield it should he have occasion to. However, for the time being he holds it in abeyance, a further sign of his confidence and courage in his abilities to lead. He is guided directly by the Sphere of Light, which has settled in the crown of his head, a sign of his direct communication with the realms of light and knowledge. Should the King of Swords present himself in your reading, he often represents individuals in positions of power or authority. From his summit, he views the events and experiences of The Way, absorbing and analyzing the circumstances of the matter, should you seek his counsel. His strength is in his silence; his greatest value is not in his words, but rather in his example. This card calls you to meditation, to seek, to be collected and balanced in your judgments. With time and reflection, you’ll be able to see clearly the solution to the problem at hand. As the majestic King, if the situation calls for it, be prepared to stand alone in your wisdom and rectitude. Don’t allow yourself to get corrupted or stray from the heart of the matter, and let your actions speak for themselves. Try to embody the qualities of the King of Swords, take the challenges that are presented and find solutions through a clear and collected mind. WANDS"
