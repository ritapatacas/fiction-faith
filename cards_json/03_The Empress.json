  "reversed": {
    "overview": "The Empress reversed indicates that you have lost too much of your own willpower and strength because you have started placing too much effort and concern to other people’s affairs. While the Empress's nature is of showering her loved ones with attention and care, this can sometimes go overboard. You might be neglecting your own needs, or even smothering the ones you love with your well-intentioned actions.\nIn a role reversal, perhaps a reversed Empress is finding her way into your life; it could also mean that you are relying on others to take care of you, and make decisions for you. You need to work towards removing this influence on your life, and build confidence in your own actions. Always try as much as you can to ensure that you solve matters on your own.",
    "love_meaning": null,
    "career_meaning": "Your career may be feeling stale, tedious and unfulfilling right now. It may feel that you’re making little progress when it comes to developing your skills and abilities. The work is monotonous, and perhaps you’ve already mastered what you can do in this position. You may feel that others don’t appreciate the work you’re doing, further adding to your frustration. At times, this card also can point to a feeling of being insecure when it comes to your career. This may also be causing the other problems you’re experiencing. It’s important to take the time now and sort out which of these are problems that require an external change, like switching jobs, versus an internal one, like developing better confidence and communication skills.",
    "finances_meaning": "Since the Empress is generally a great card to have with finances, even in the reversed position, she still signals a comfortable amount of financial stability. However, in reverse, she may suggest that despite you having enough, you may still feel unstable. Sometimes, this can come from growing up in poverty, or is just the nature of being self-employed. You may have to do some internal work to understand why this is so; and what you can do to change it. Continue to be responsible with your finances, and it’s likely you’ll be fine.",
    "as_feelings": "When you pull the reversed Empress in response to how someone feels about you, it suggests that this person may be experiencing feelings of insecurity or emotional distance. They might struggle with nurturing their connection with you, feeling overwhelmed by self-doubt or a lack of confidence in your relationship. Their affection could feel stifled, as if they are unable to express themselves fully due to fears of inadequacy.\nIn the realm of your own feelings, the reversed Empress indicates a sense of disconnection from your own emotions and desires.

  "abyss": "The Empress is the Bringer of Life. She walks the Earth with grace, love, and care, cradling her ripe belly as she births the world around her. She is in perfect harmony with all her surroundings and her intentions are from the heart. She is Mother Nature at her core, the epitome of fruitfulness and bounty. She is summer in her prime, her hands blending and shaping the world around her, leaving a trail of blooming flowers and new life. In some instances, that creative energy can take the shape of artistic birth or even physical birth. Whereas the High Priestess represented the virginal aspect, the Empress represents the maternal aspect, physically active in her creation and a problem solver. She is the creator, the birther of creativity, of life itself. When she appears in your spread, she brings with her the active forces of progression, whether in love, business, creation, or literally pregnancy and physical birth. Be open to what this period will bring and utilize her gifts wisely. There is also a sense of hope that comes with this card, the idea that all the work that was put in at the beginning was not in vain. Since the Empress is shown at the end of her pregnancy, this too is an indication of an abundant outcome that will soon materialize. If you were to search for her in your own life, you'd most likely find her as a woman who is important to you, someone helpful and influential."
