  "description": "One of the most iconic images in the tarot, the Three of Swords displays a floating heart that is pierced by three swords. Above it, there are heavy clouds. There is also a heavy downpour in the background. The symbolism is pretty opaque, and the emotional effect that it has is immediate. The heart is the seat of warmth, affection and spirit, and the three swords indicate the power to harm, cause pain, and create suffering to what it pierces. This is an image of grief, loss and literally heartbreak. The clouds and rain depict the surrounding grimness of the situation. All these symbols point to the Three of Swords showing a low point in one's life.",

    "overview": "The Three of Swords depicts the message of rejection, betrayal, hurt and discouragement. In moments like these, we are well served by the mind. If you can think logically about it and prepare for the experience, the impact of this pain may be minimized.\n\nBut remember too, that pain and grief are a normal part of life, because they make us appreciate what joy and happiness we have, as well as teaching us. It is through pain that we learn to be avoid mistakes that could lead us into danger and grief. It is therefore a necessity in the journey of life. The Three of Swords therefore is a depiction of suffering that is meant to make us stronger, more careful and more vigilant.\n\nSometimes life gives us no choice - we are knocked down. But what determines one's future is the choice of whether to remain down, or rise again.\n\nSometimes life gives us no choice - we are knocked down. But what determines one's future is the choice of whether to remain knocked down, or rise again. Each little piece of suffering you encounter serves as a stepping stone to find a deeper meaning in this world. This card comes at a time when you need to prepare yourself for this next stage in life. While the grief may be extremely hurtful, it enables you to forget your past and focus on your future knowing that you have control of what actions you take afterwards. Don’t dwell so much on what is troubling you but instead, focus on what is approaching, because you determine your fate.",
    "love_meaning": "The imagery of this card is plain and simple; heartbreak is to come with the 3 of Swords tarot love meaning. This is likely to be a time in your life of tears, sadness and heartbreak. If you’re in a relationship, this can sometimes point to a breakup, a conflict, or some kind of separation. In the worst case scenario, since this card is a three, it can also point to a third party creating trouble in your relationship. You and your partner may have to face difficult problems in order to remain together. Without clear and respectful discussions and a willingness to work together, the relationship can reach its end. If you’re single, it may be that past grief and suffering is affecting your ability to date. Past wounds have not yet healed, and it’s important to give yourself time before you attempt to find love again.",
    "career_meaning": "Work can be a great source of stress, frustration and sadness for you right now. At worst, it can point to a sudden job loss, or collapse of a company. More commonly, it can signal some kind of conflict at work amongst clients and colleagues. If you’re dealing with this, make sure that you have honest and open conversations with your coworkers, while keeping things respectful. There’s likely a lot that you all can learn from one another. If you’re looking for work, or you have just lost your job, the search right now can leave you hopeless. Don’t be disheartened; if you can afford it, take the time now to recover from this period of anguish. It may provide you a more positive mindset for your job search.",
    "finances_meaning": "You may be dealing with a material loss right now, or at least something in your financial life causing you a lot of stress. A breakup has both emotional and financial consequences; you may no longer be able to afford your apartment alone, or you may have to split your assets in a divorce. All these things can be overwhelming now. Make sure to be gentle with yourself, but also remember not to avoid taking care of these things. Find support; you can make it through.",
    "as_feelings": "The upright Three of Swords reveals a profound heartache and emotional turmoil. This person is likely wrestling with feelings of betrayal or sadness, shaped by past experiences that taint their view of your relationship. They feel torn between their affection for you and the lingering pain that clouds their judgment.\nIn terms of your own emotions, this card indicates you're facing a similar struggle. You may be hurt or disappointed by the circumstances surrounding this connection, leading to confusion and sorrow. Acknowledge these feelings instead of pushing them aside; doing so will open the door to healing and clarity as you move forward.",

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "With the reversed 3 of Swords tarot love meaning, lovers may find themselves settling their conflicts and forgiving one another. There is a desire here to heal, and move past old wounds, while looking forwards towards the future. For singles, this often means finally getting over past heartbreak, in order to be fully present in your dating life again. However, this card can also sometimes instead suggest the very opposite. Wounds may not be healing, but they may be repressed, so they fester and create resentment. Partners may not be able to forgive one another for past hurts. Sometimes, in these cases, it can be better for both to move on.",

    "career_meaning": "Things at work are starting to become bright again. Stressful conflicts are beginning to resolve, and your outlook and general happiness are improving as well. Your colleagues may have moved on from the conflict, or the person that was causing frustration has left. Everyone at work may instead be focusing on forgiving past mistakes, and working together on the future. Communication has improved, and there may be new processes in place to avoid the mistakes of the past. Sometimes though, this card can also point towards a worsening of circumstances, where instead of putting issues behind them, they can hold grudges and remain negative. Surrounding cards will give more context.",
    "finances_meaning": "If you’ve been suffering from financial setbacks, the reversed 3 of Swords can signal that improvement is coming. You can be rebuilding your savings, or finding yourself in a better, more stable financial position than you were in before. Alternatively, this card can also indicate that the level of emotional grief after a financial loss is getting worse. If you’ve gone through a big loss, you may find it very difficult to adjust your spending habits, or give up your past living standards. Not accepting the truth of your position often makes a tough situation more difficult.",
    "as_feelings": "The arrival of the reversed Three of Swords suggests a powerful moment of healing and release from past pain. This person may be moving beyond heartbreak or disappointment, allowing themselves to open up emotionally. They feel a growing sense of hope and are beginning to see the potential for connection with you, as if they are shedding old wounds that once held them back.\nIn terms of your own feelings, this card invites reflection on how you might also be experiencing a shift away from sorrow or resentment. You could be finding clarity and understanding within yourself, recognizing that it's time to let go of negative emotions. Embracing forgiveness; both for yourself and others - can lead you toward emotional freedom and renewed optimism in your relationship journey.",
    "as_actions": "In the realm of emotional healing, drawing the Three of Swords reversed suggests that now is the time to heal and release past emotional pain. You should focus on forgiveness, both for yourself and others, allowing you to let go of burdens that weigh you down. This may involve having open conversations with those who have hurt you or seeking closure in unresolved situations. Additionally, consider engaging in activities that promote self-care and emotional well-being, such as journaling your feelings or practicing mindfulness. By shifting your perspective towards healing rather than dwelling on sorrow, you can create space for new opportunities and healthier relationships in your life."

  "abyss": "Some people have a different way of interpreting the Three of Swords, based on the numerological properties of the number 3, the Triad. Because the Suit of Swords deals with the element of air, and therefore the mind, the suit as a whole can be interpreted as a progression from unknowing to knowing. Since the Ace of Swords, associated with number 1 (also known as the Monad), is a card that brings the discovery of truth, the number 1 is the creative “big bang” of the mind. The Two of Swords, associated with the number 2 (the Dyad), is all about duality and the choices of the mind. We've now reached the number 3 (the Triad), in the Three of Swords, where what we've learned from the Ace of Swords (1 = truth and creativity) combined with the Two of Swords (2 = the ability to make choices and proper discernment), brings us to the growth and expansion of the mind through multiplicity, new ways of thinking and seeing things. It calls for harmony and equilibrium between the two forces that once were opposing. For this reason, the card portrays the image of a young man in the midst of gaining knowledge. Three swords stand upright piercing the Book of Thought, unlocking the living knowledge as it flies off the pages. They take flight and enter the receptive grail of the mind, a fertile ground where their seeds can germinate and develop fully if properly tended to."
