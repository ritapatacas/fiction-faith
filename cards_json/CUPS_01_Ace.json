  "description": "In the Ace of Cups card, there is a hand emanating from the clouds holding out a cup, as if in a offer to the querent to take a drink. This cup is overflowing with sparkling water which symbolizes pure and pristine emotion. If you take this offer, drinking from this cup will surely bring you nothing short of emotional as well as spiritual fulfillment.\nThe cup has five streams of water overflowing from the brim. These five streams represent the power of intuition and show the importance of listening to your inner voice. In order to obtain the kind of emotional or spiritual fulfillment that is depicted in the Ace of Cups, the querent will need to follow this inner voice, and remain true to it, regardless of the situation. This will require emotional discipline, but the rewards that this can bring are hinted at within the card itself: overflowing joy and happiness.",

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "Some sadness and emotional upset can be signaled by the reversed Ace of Cups tarot love meaning. This may have stemmed from an argument or even a break up, leaving you to feel alone and vulnerable. This card can also simply mean feeling a bit somber about your current relationship, or perhaps having a temporary loss of faith. Something is blocking you from being able to experience, give and receive true love. You may not be meeting your partner, or others in general, with an open heart. It is likely that insecurity is playing a strong role; we must all be able to love ourselves before we can truly love another person. Try and look inward, and give yourself the love that you want before seeking it in another.",

    "career_meaning": "When reversed, the good news and comradery of the Ace of Cups is subverted. For those who are searching for a new position, you may be disappointed. There may be some negative emotions surrounding your work. You may find frustration and obstacles, as well as a feeling of emptiness when it comes to your job. Whatever the reason is, you may likely also feel uninspired and unmotivated at work right now. Sometimes, as the cups also rule relationships, you may find that co-workers can be less friendly and helpful at this time. Do your best to weather the storm and find motivation where possible. If nothing else, try to remember that work is only one aspect of your life, not everything.",
    "finances_meaning": "With the reversed Ace of Cups, you may get news that you don’t quite want to hear when it comes to your finances. If you applied to take out a loan or receive a grant, there may be some disappointment headed your way. Perhaps asking for assistance from family or friends has not yielded any results either. If none of these situations apply to you, you may just be dealing with some feelings of ambivalence or frustration when it comes to your financial situation. Let yourself feel, but not be consumed by these emotions.",
    "as_feelings": "When the Reversed Ace of Cups appears in the context of feelings, it suggests emotional blockage or confusion. This card can indicate emotional emptiness, unfulfilled love, or a lack of connection with your inner emotions. Your emotional well-being may be challenged, and you may need to address unresolved personal issues in order to find inner peace and fulfillment.",
    "as_actions": "In terms of actions, the Reversed Ace of Cups advises caution in expressing or acting upon your emotions. You may need to take a step back and reflect before making any impulsive decisions, especially if they're based on any intense feelings you may be experiencing. Now is a time to focus on healing emotional wounds, resolving conflicts, and nurturing yourself before taking any significant steps forward. Remember to approach situations with a clear mind.\nNew relationships will require caution and reflection before moving forward. Avoid rushing into a relationship without knowing how you truly feel or what your needs are. Existing relationships are advised to address emotional blockages that may hinder you from becoming closer. A joint effort may be needed to work through emotional barriers. If you're looking for guidance on ex-lovers, the Ace of Cups reversed emphasizes the necessity to process and let go; you may be too tied to past relationships to be open to new love.In work, you may need to reassess whether the current path is truly satisfying for you or if a change is warranted.\nPerhaps a shift towards a career better aligned with your emotional needs is suggested; purpose and fulfillment is just as important as financial stability."

  "abyss": "The Suit of Cups deals with emotions and matters of the heart. The Ace of Cups is about that initial burst of emotions when a relationship is fresh and new. In drawing this card, I wanted to capture the idea of that emotional rush, its wild and untamed nature. The waters of the soul explode forth from the woman's solar plexus, the core of emotions in the body. They wing their way towards the goblet held in her outstretched hand, but they could easily miss their mark. This energy is still young and new; it is primitive and unpredictable. Who knows where it could lead, or if it will flow for reward or ruin? The Ace of Cups shows up in a reading when we are in the process of getting in touch with our feelings. It can also be referring to a strong attraction that is developing or about to come into your life. This is the time to let your heart be heard; logic will not help you in this situation. The Ace of Cups sets the stage for establishing a deeper bond in a relationship, whether romantically or platonically. In order for this to happen, you need to let down your walls and let your feelings be known. You will also have to invest yourself and your time for this to become a reality."
