  "abyss": "The Five of Cups is a card of loss, regret, and sorrow. That feeling that is raw and cuts to the core so deep that we can't breathe. The figure in the card is slumped over, holding his head in his hands. He is overwhelmed by his grief and loss, isolated and alone. Three cups have been knocked over, their precious contents dashed over the cliff. Even so, there are still two cups left for him to drink from. If he can just muster enough energy to raise his head, he will see that there is still hope of recovery. The two full cups bear the runes of Dagaz, symbol of hope and achievement, and Eihwaz, symbol of rebirth and endurance. The Five of Cups is one of the hardest cards to be dealt in the tarot. The depth of emotional distress it indicates can sometimes even point towards bereavement of a loved one. Perhaps you or someone you love is grieving. There is deep sadness that comes with this card; however, all is not lost. This is the moment where you choose whether to see the glass as half empty or half full. It's all a matter of perspective and dwelling on things that cannot be changed will only fix you in your suffering. Loss of any kind is hard, but just as the figure in the card, there is hope and opportunity to move through it if you just pick up your head. You do not have to remain alone, and you can focus instead on hope and recovery."
