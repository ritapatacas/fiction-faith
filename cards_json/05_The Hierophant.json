  "description": "The card depicts a religious figure that sits in a rather formal environment characteristic for a church. He is wearing three elaborate vestments which are designated to represent the three different worlds. His right hand is properly raised in an act of benediction, a sign of blessing – it’s the same hand that the Magician has raised. In his other hand, he carries a triple cross, which is associated traditionally with the pope. Each of the horizontal bars in the cross are thought to represent the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Beneath him, two acolytes are seated, representing the transfer of sacred knowledge within institutions. Through these acolytes, the card also comes to represent following the path to knowledge and education.\n\nThis card is also known as the High Priest in certain decks - as well as the Pope. He is acting as the masculine counterpart of another card which is known as the High Priestess. This card is ruled by Taurus.",

It also suggests that you want to stay within certain conventional bounds of what could be considered an orthodox approach. So, instead of being innovative, you will be adapting to certain beliefs and systems which are already put in place and are existing.\n\nThe Hierophant card suggests that it’s better for you to follow social structures which are established and have their own traditions\n\nThe Hierophant card suggests that it’s better for you to follow social structures which are established and have their own traditions.

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "When you see the Hierophant in reverse, it may mean that you are feeling particularly restricted and even constrained from too many structures and rules. As a result, you have lost quite a lot of control as well as flexibility in your life. You have a particularly strong will and desire to go ahead and regain control as well as to break free from the shackles of convention. You are tempted to try unorthodox approaches or to function in a way which defies social ties and norms.\nThe Hierophant reversal meaning is mostly about questioning certain traditions and making sure that whatever it is that you do is the right thing for you in this certain moment.",
    "love_meaning": null,
    "career_meaning": "Your creativity, achievement or freedom at your workplace can feel stifled by bureaucracy, processes, or rules right now. You may feel restricted and confined. If you had the options, you may have been able to solve many of your organization’s problems, but they may be stubborn to keep things done “their way”. Sometimes this can mean in order to get things done, you would have to engage in chumming up to your colleagues, or even your boss. There may be a lot of pressure to follow the organization’s decisions even when you have a differing opinion. Weigh the risks of going your own way; can you stay true to your own opinions where you are currently?",
    "finances_meaning": "The advice of your peers when it comes to finances can feel stifling to you at the moment. You may have the itch to take risks and try new ways of earning your money, whether that means working on a side-project in your spare time, or learning about cryptocurrency. Remain responsible and realistic about what kinds of risks you’re willing to take, and what you’re willing to lose.",
    "as_feelings": "When you pull the reversed Hierophant in response to how someone feels about you, it reveals a sense of confusion and rebellion within them. They may feel disconnected from traditional values or societal expectations, leading to uncertainty about their emotions toward you. This person might be questioning norms and seeking authenticity, which can create a push-pull dynamic in your relationship as they navigate their feelings.\nWith regard to your own emotions, the reversed Hierophant suggests that you are feeling restless and perhaps even stifled by conventional beliefs or routines. You crave freedom and self-discovery, prompting you to explore new perspectives on love and connection. Embrace this desire for growth; it’s an invitation to break free from limitations and seek deeper understanding within yourself.",
    "as_actions": "As the Hierophant appears in reverse, it’s time to break free from conventional thinking and explore your own beliefs. This is a call to challenge established norms and seek personal truths rather than adhering to societal expectations. In practical terms, consider engaging in activities that foster independent thought, such as journaling or exploring new philosophies through books or podcasts. Attend workshops that encourage creative expression or join groups focused on alternative perspectives. Embrace experiences outside your comfort zone, allowing yourself to question traditions and discover what resonates with you personally. This journey of self-discovery will lead to greater authenticity in your life choices.",
    "love": "stale relationship, values not aligned, breaking taboo",
    "career": "bureaucracy, stifling, confined workplace, peer pressure",
    "finances": "new financial institutions, taking risks with finances"

  "abyss": "The Wise One is traditionally known as the Hierophant. In this card, he represents the spiritual healer, the shaman. We witness the exchange between the healer and his people, a sacred moment when he is passing down his knowledge and wisdom. Tradition is important to him, something that has taken generations to acquire and master and cannot be achieved through solitude or isolation. The fire is burning bright and with its heat it warms their souls and lights the path of enlightenment. When this card appears, know that perhaps some spiritual guidance is coming your way. There are many forms through which this knowledge may come into your life, perhaps through a counselor or a spiritual mentor. However it may be, guidance is coming your way. The Wise One is a card of doctrine and of spiritual tradition. And at its core, tradition in general is passed down and continues living within a group setting. Perhaps you've been searching for a group of spiritually minded people to connect with? If spiritual doctrine is not your cup of tea, a good balance can come from incorporating some aspects of tradition into your spiritual practice—things that could become ritual and feed your soul."
