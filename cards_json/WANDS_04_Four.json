It’s highly likely that there is a lot of tension between the members of your family or other loved ones. If you have completed something that is important to you, you are expecting to share it with those that are closest to you, and to come home to a welcome celebration, but instead, you find a lack of support. This may leave you feeling rather uncertain when it comes to your own relationships as well as the things that you can and cannot depend on.",

The 4 of Wands tarot love meaning can signal incompatibilities between your larger community of friends and family, and your partner, or the way that you are approaching love and romance. Sometimes, since this card is also the card of deepening your commitments on a more public level, there can be some fear and hesitation about taking these next steps. Change, especially binding oneself with another person, can be wonderful and rewarding, as well as terrifying. These emotions can exist together, but only you will be able to know whether it comes from a deeper place than just cold feet.",
    "career_meaning": "When reversed, the convivial nature of the four of wands is subverted. As a result, it might be that, at work, your relationships are under strain or have been harder to form. This difficulty can apply in a general sense to your office’s atmosphere; alternatively, it may be in reference to a specific moment or point of tension at work. For instance, there may be office events approaching, but they will likely not go as planned. Instead of increasing comradery, they might have the opposite effect. If there are no specific concerns in your work setting, it is likely that the card is highlighting the general state of your office. Perhaps the atmosphere at work is harsh or unfriendly. Regardless, expect ruder behaviors from the people you work with and be aware of them in yourself as well.",
    "finances_meaning": "You might be struggling against a poor economic situation if you find the four of wand here. Your financial troubles are likely linked to your personal relationships. It is possible that family expenses are weighing you down at the moment. You might be having a particularly difficult time making ends meet at this time due to these unforeseen expenditures. Be wary of friends or family asking for money that you cannot afford to give. Ask whether the money is necessary or just a desire on their part. If it is the latter, consider trying to rein in your finances first before assisting them.",
    "as_feelings": "The arrival of the reversed Four of Wands suggests that the person you are inquiring about feels a sense of instability or disconnection regarding their emotions towards you. They may be grappling with feelings of uncertainty and lack of commitment, possibly reflecting on past experiences that have left them hesitant to fully embrace what could be between you. Their emotional landscape is marked by confusion, making it difficult for them to celebrate or acknowledge any potential joy in your connection.\nYou might feel a similar unease within yourself as this card resonates with your own emotions.

Embrace this opportunity for self-reflection; understanding these feelings can lead to greater emotional insight and growth for both of you.",

  "abyss": "The Four of Wands is a happy card, one I’m always eager to receive in a reading. It’s a card that signals stability and a sense of completion. In drawing the Four of Wands for Tarot of the Abyss, I wanted to somehow capture that moment of pure, unbridled happiness when you celebrate a major milestone. Reflecting on those moments when I have felt happiest and most celebrated as a person, I came upon the idea of a birthday party. The woman in the card is seated before a birthday cake, with a look of sheer joy on her face. The cake has been prepared to her taste, especially for her. We can almost hear the off-tune chorus of her loved ones singing “Happy Birthday” in the background. In a moment, she will close her eyes, make a magic wish, and blow out the candles to seal her wish’s success. Regardless of how old we are, it is a moment of pure, almost child-like joy and jubilation. The Four of Wands calls out to you to savor your success and take a moment to reflect on your accomplishments. There are different ways this can come into play; it may be an actual celebration, or it can come in the form of an unexpected event, one that will usher in a new period of your life."
