  "description": "The Three of Pentacles displays a young apprentice who works in a cathedral. In front of him, there are two others, a priest and a nobleman of some sort, that are holding plans of the cathedral on a piece of parchment. We can tell from the way the apprentice has raised his head that he is discussing his progress on building the cathedral. The two others are keenly listening to him in order to more clearly understand what is needed of them and how they can provide guidance.

  "abyss": "The artwork for this card is self-explanatory. Three hands work together to pull a rope in a seeming game of tug of war. Each individual is strong on their own, but together, they are much more likely to overcome the forces against them.
