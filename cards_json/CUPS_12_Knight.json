  "description": "The Knight of Cups is a card which depicts a young knight who is gloriously riding a white horse while at the same time holding a cup as if he is a messenger of a certain sort. Unlike the Knight of Wands or the Knight of Swords, this particular one isn’t charging along with his horse. He is instead moving slowly forward which provides the entire setting an overall impression of peace and calmness. The horse is known to represent one's drive, energy, and power. The horse's color is white, which is a well-known symbol of spirituality, light, and purity.",

    "overview": "The truth is that the Knight of Cups is the most feminine amongst all the Knight cards in the tarot. It's important to note though, that this doesn’t even slightly suggest that he is any less of a worthy knight. It implies that he is in proper touch with his emotions and his intuition, and that he uses them for his own well-being and during his many romance and seduction quests. He is usually quite attractive and charming to others, regardless of their gender.\nWhen faced with an actual decision, the Knight of Cups is going to listen to his heart, regardless of whether this is actually a logical choice or not. He can also manifest as an event or a person in your life, or a part of your own self. He appears as a messenger – and with him, he carries an invitation or an arrival of something or someone which is going to have a certain emotional benefit for you. As a knight, he is also charged with taking the gifts of his suit, and bringing it outward into the world. He therefore can also represent the undertaking of some project with significant emotional or creative value for you.\n\nHe appears as a messenger – and with him, he carries an invitation or an arrival of something or someone which will benefit you.",

  "abyss": "The Knight of Cups is the active force of emotion. In this card, we see the Knight as a sailor, hoisting the sails, taking control and actively directing the ship. His focus allows him to constructively channel his emotions into navigating the ship successfully through the turbulent waters. The Knight of Cups can represent the active force of emotions, or an actual individual with the qualities of the Knight. The person can be sensitive and temperamental.

However, just like he's seen here pulling the ropes to control the ship, the Knight of Cups can and will pull the strings of the heart. Should this card present itself to you, it can also signal the need to start acting on your feelings, to embody the qualities of the Knight of Cups."
