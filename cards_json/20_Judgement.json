  "description": "This card depicts what one would imagine the last judgment would be, in the various forms that takes in many mythologies. The image in the Judgement card shows women, men, and children who are rising from the grave to respond to Gabriel’s trumpet call. Their outstretched arms symbolize that they are ready to be judged by the universe. They are about to meet their creator, their actions weighed, and find out where they will spend the remainder of eternity: in heaven or in hell. The massive tidal wave in the background signify that judgement is unavoidable, and that this judgement will be final.\n\nJudgement is ruled by Pluto, who is the underworld’s ruler. There are echoes of this card in Death, for they both remind us that everything comes to an end and that a new beginning is coming.",

You are most likely not giving yourself the time or space to fully think about the matter and learn the lessons you need to to be able to progress with awareness. You could also be too critical of your past actions, so you are not giving yourself the forgiveness to move forward. The mistakes that we have made in the past are learning tools, so they help us move though life. Focusing too hard on these mistakes can cause us to trip and fall.",

Are there attitudes you have to love that you have been blind to but are deeply affecting your approach to dating? This card is asking you to see yourself and your relationships with honesty. Facing the truth can also free you.",
    "career_meaning": "Perhaps you have been too harsh on yourself lately. If you’ve made mistakes at work, you may find that it is hard to let those feelings of disappointment with yourself go, instead of making amends and moving on. You may be left with a lingering sense of doubt about your own abilities. Alternatively, this card can signal that you are unable to take responsibility for your own actions, and not learning the lessons you need to in order to take the next steps in your career. Your lack of awareness when it comes to handling yourself may be grating on colleagues. Have you been doing all that you can when it comes to your work projects? Have you communicated well? Or do you always shift the blame to others?",

  "abyss": "The woman rises as a phoenix from the ashes, having completed her arduous journey of metamorphosis and growth. Her outgrown former self, lying empty beneath her, is nothing more than an empty hollow husk. She bears no more guilt or burdens, she has risen victorious to a new phase of life. The woman is still exhausted from having completed her journey of change and growth. She embraces a new self, exploring her wings in freedom and liberation. She is poised, gathering her strength for whatever challenges and opportunities lie ahead. The Awakening card (formerly Judgment) invites you to take note of your life objectively; to step back and consider how much you've grown and learned. You may be getting to the point where you've outgrown certain relationships or jobs and certain chapters of your life may be drawing to a close. Perhaps you are reluctant to complete the final metamorphosis. No doubt comfort and stability can be appealing, however, sometimes life has other plans for us when we try to cling to the past. You may be reaching an important milestone and as is often the case, it comes with major decisions or changes. If you have been feeling down or in need of forgiveness, the Awakening card will bring solace and reintegration. Be prepared and be as the butterfly, take your time to regenerate, but get ready to fly and soar!"
