  "description": "In the Lovers card, the man and the woman in the image are being protected and blessed by an angel above. The couple seems secure and happy in their home, which appears to be the Garden of Eden. The fruit tree with the snake behind the woman is a reference to that story, which tells of humanity's fall into temptation and into the realm of flesh and sensuality. The angel depicted here is Raphael, the angel of air - who is of the same element of the zodiac sign that governs this card: Gemini. Air is associated with mental activity, and communication in particular, which is the foundation for healthy relationships. His blessing seems to give this card a sense of balance and harmony, the symbolization of union in a grand and cosmic sense between two opposing forces.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "The primary meaning within the Lovers is harmony, attractiveness, and perfection in a relationship. The trust and the unity that the lovers have gives each of them confidence and strength, empowering the other. The bond that they have created is very strong, and it can indicate that the two are joined in marriage, and other close and intimate relationships.\n\nThe trust and the unity that the lovers have gives each of them confidence and strength, empowering the other.\n\nAnother meaning behind the lovers card is the concept of choice - a choice between things that are opposing and mutually exclusive. This could be a dilemma that you need to think about carefully and make the best decision for your situation.\nA more personal Lovers meaning that can apply to individuals is the development of your own personal belief systems, regardless of what are the societal norms. We see this as a development from the Hierophant, who made decrees and passed on his knowledge through a standardized system. This is one of the times when you figure out what you are going to stand for, and what your philosophy in life will truly be. You must start making up your mind about what you find important and unimportant in your life. You should be as true to yourself as you can be, so you will be genuine and authentic to the people who are around you.",
    "love_meaning": "When it comes to love and relationships, the Lovers card can be a welcome sight to any seeker. The Lovers tarot card signals a wonderful cohesiveness and balance of forces, indicating complimentary energies. This card represents a pair that works well together. On the other hand, because this card also symbolizes choice, and the choice of commitment, it also raises questions of how committed you are to love. This doesn’t have to refer exclusively to another person, but can also indicate a choice between love or work, love or family, love or friendship, or even sometimes love and your entire lifestyle. The idea here is that there may be a sacrifice that you must make in order to have this love. In some ways, all commitment is a sacrifice, but one made for the right person can help you grow as an individual. The choices and sacrifices that need to be made can apply to both you, a potential or existing partner.",
    "career_meaning": "Sometimes, the Lovers can signal a business partnership, or a relationship with a colleague that is harmonious and beneficial to both parties. The Lovers card, contrary to popular belief, can also symbolize partnerships of a platonic kind, though at times, this can also signal a romantic relationship that can blossom. If this does happen, make sure you understand the kinds of risk that you open yourself up to, and make a decision both with your head as well as your heart. The Lovers tarot card can also suggest that there are big decisions that you need to make when it comes to your future career. You may be at a crossroads, or shifting from one path to another, or you may need to make choices between your work and other aspects of your life.",
    "finances_meaning": "When it comes to finances, the Lovers card can suggest that big financial decisions need to be made. You may have to choose between having one big expense versus another; the important thing to remember is that it seems like you can’t have both. One path closes the door to another path, and your choices may have larger impacts in the future.",
    "as_feelings": "The Lovers upright reveals a profound connection and mutual attraction. This person views you as a significant partner, drawn to your essence and valuing the bond you share. Their feelings are rooted in harmony and balance, reflecting an appreciation for both your chemistry and the emotional depth that arises from shared values and experiences.\nYour own feelings are prompting introspection about love and relationships. You may find yourself pondering what truly matters in this connection, carefully weighing your choices. An awakening stirs within you; a desire for unity and understanding that calls for open communication. Embrace this moment; it fosters growth both individually and together.",
    "as_actions": "The arrival of The Lovers suggests that now is the time to embrace connection and harmony in your life. You should focus on nurturing relationships, whether romantic or platonic, by engaging in open communication and vulnerability. This card encourages you to make choices that align with your values and desires, fostering deeper bonds with those around you. Consider planning a heartfelt conversation with someone important or participating in activities that strengthen your connections, like cooking together or exploring shared interests. Embrace the idea of partnership not just as a romantic notion but as a way to enhance all aspects of your life through collaboration and mutual support.",
    "love": "balanced, loving, supportive relationship, choices about love",
    "career": "business partnership, romance at work, choices about career",
    "finances": "mutually exclusive financial choices"
  },
  "reversed": {
    "overview": "The Lovers reversed can point to both inner and outer conflicts that you are dealing with. The disharmony can make daily life difficult and could be putting pressure on your relationships. You should take time to think about what you are punishing yourself for, so you can fix them or let them go. At this time, you should also think about your personal values and belief system to make sure that they are aligned with what you want from your life.\n\nA break in communication could be another possible interpretation. The foundation for your relationships may be cut off, creating an imbalance between you and your partner or loved ones. The unity normally present within the card has become lopsided.\n\nThe Lovers reversed can also indicate that you have been avoiding responsibility for your actions. You could have made a decision that was based on your desire for immediate gratification but are now blaming others for the consequences that are catching up to you. So, you need to make amends or let go of the past and make better decisions in the future.",
    "love_meaning": "The reversed Lovers in a relationship or romance tarot reading can suggest there is a coldness within your relationship. What was in balance is no longer working. Some issue likely stands in the way of your relationship, and must be resolved to once again form a closer bond.\n\nSometimes, a fear of commitment may also be indicated. This may be a time when you have many suitors, or your dating life may be very active. While this may be fun at first, you may be feeling that there are too many choices, or too many possibilities that you have to give up in order to develop a partnership. This will likely require some introspection on your part; make sure you are honest with yourself about your fears as well as your desires.",
    "career_meaning": "You may have conflicts between your colleagues, or a business partner when the Lovers card is reversed. You may need to have long discussions in order to agree to a decision that everyone can accept. Or there may be one person that is doing all the work, or has to carry their teammate who has lost all motivation. Both colleagues may be dragged down because of one person’s inability to put in their fair share of work. At times, this card does indicate a romantic relationship started at your workplace, but reversed, this can spell trouble for you. There are likely to be consequences that you did not foresee should you continue down this path.",
    "finances_meaning": "Your financial choices may be rather impulsive right now, meaning your long term financial security can be threatened. Are you making responsible choices, or are you looking for immediate gratification? Make sure that you understand what you’re truly able to afford when it comes to your finances.",
    "as_feelings": "The arrival of the reversed Lovers card suggests that this person is grappling with confusion and imbalance in their emotions. They may feel torn between attraction and doubt, struggling to commit fully due to unresolved issues or past experiences. Their feelings are clouded by uncertainty, leading them to question the connection rather than embrace it wholeheartedly.\nIn terms of your own feelings, the reversed Lovers indicates a sense of disconnection or misalignment within yourself. You might be feeling conflicted about what you truly want from this relationship, battling inner doubts that prevent you from experiencing genuine intimacy. This card urges you to reflect on your desires and values, encouraging clarity so that you can navigate these emotional waters with confidence and purpose.",
    "as_actions": "The arrival of The Lovers reversed suggests that you should focus on self-discovery and reevaluate your relationships. This card indicates a need to step back from partnerships or commitments that may not serve your best interests. Consider taking time for introspection, journaling about what truly matters to you, and identifying any patterns in past relationships that have led to dissatisfaction. Engage in activities that promote personal growth, such as pursuing a new hobby or attending workshops focused on self-improvement. By prioritizing your own needs and desires, you'll gain clarity on the connections worth nurturing in your life moving forward.",
    "love": "cold, detached partner, too many suitors, imbalance in relationship",
    "career": "conflicts between colleagues, romance at work leading to trouble",
    "finances": "impulsive financial choices, not responsible about finances"

  "abyss": "There is nothing more beautiful to me than nature itself. Trees have always fascinated me, their rough exterior hiding their vulnerable life force. They can be as straight as arrows, but at the same time bend with the wind. They adapt their solid bodies, innately knowing their survival depends on it. Their roots run deep within the earth, sharing nutrients and a bonding with others of their kind that is unseen for all the rest of us. For this reason, I chose two bonding trees to represent the Lovers. Two trees bend to reach each other, their roots intertwining, almost becoming one entity. It has taken many years for them to be able to connect in such a way, through storms and drought, their only witnesses the changing seasons of the soul. They do not need to express their love verbally; their love is shared instantly and equally. And through their merging, they are stronger still. The Lovers is a card that represents a deep soul-felt connection with someone. Some would call it finding their soulmate, their life companion. And even though, generally speaking, this card does deal with romantic relationships, it often goes beyond this level of interpretation. The Lovers card talks about allowing yourself to be vulnerable and true, letting the other person know you for who you truly are. Break down the walls and trust that the other person will be there for you. Just like the trees have joined their roots together into one, so must you in your own relationship. You may be pleasantly surprised by what you discover!"
