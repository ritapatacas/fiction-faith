  "description": "Another one of the most striking and ominous cards in the deck, the Ten of Swords shows a man lying flat on the ground with his face facing the dirt. He is covered with a red cloth from the chest down to his legs. Ten long swords are stabbed into his back, he may not have seen this end coming. There is a terrible stillness in the air: the sky above him is black and cloudy indicating the fear and negativity associated with death. The waters in front of him are still, with no ripples - adding to the eerie stillness and finality of this card. Looking into the horizon, in the east, the sun is rising, and the weather seems very calm despite the darkness. The Ten of Swords seems to intimate that this is the lowest point in one's life, and it cannot get worse than this. At least, even in this state, the sun is rising.",

    "overview": "The Ten of Swords indicate a major disaster of some sort. It shows that a certain force of extreme magnitude has come to hit you in your life - one that you may have not foreseen. There is a sense of betrayal that is indicated here, for the character is stabbed in the back. This seems to be a reminder that despite how much we try, we cannot control everything - there are things that are beyond our ability to change. Here, this situation is unavoidable.\n\nThe tale of the suit of swords is a powerful metaphor, one that ends in tragedy. The swords are a symbol of the intellect, of intelligence and logic, and yet we find the final culmination of this suit a complete and total defeat of the spirit. We must realize that the swords are a weapon that can have immense potential for destruction or for good. The story as it unfolds from the ace to the ten is one where an untrained individual uses this weapon for faulty reasons - makes many mistakes, and then spends an entire lifetime attempting to run away from the power that he misused.\n\nThe story as it unfolds from the ace to the ten is one where an untrained individual uses this weapon for faulty reasons - makes many mistakes, and then spends an entire lifetime attempting to run away from the power that he misused.\n\nThis person believes the swords are external to him when they are part of him, and when they inevitably return, he once again suffers. His pain is not the pain of his circumstances usually, but the pain of fear, of anxiety, of not being able to be a master of his surroundings. After the hopelessness of the nine of swords, what could have happened? Were you overwhelmed by the pressure? Or did you take the final sword upon yourself and admit defeat?\n\nThe Ten of Swords depicts that situation where your mentality is ‘poor me’, you feel like there is nothing you can do. Pause and remember that as with the death card, the end of something means a new beginning. Let go of what you have lost, and focus on the new path forward because that is where your life is meant to go. A good example is a break-up with your partner - though it could be intensely painful, it could also be the beginning of a new sense of independence.",
    "love_meaning": "Unfortunately, the 10 of Swords tarot love meaning can indicate a relationship that is coming to its end, or a period of time filled with suffering, bitterness, grief and pain. Likely, the relationship was headed towards failure of some sort, and you may have already seen it coming. Sometimes, this card can also suggest betrayal, indicating infidelity. While this period of time may be incredibly difficult, you’ll need to come to terms with it and accept the inevitable end. Singles may be dealing with similar feelings that have lingered after a past relationship. Only with acceptance, can you truly heal, and move forward. The worst has happened, and despite how it looks, it can only get better from here.",
    "career_meaning": "In the worst case, you may be reaching the end of your current job right now, as the 10 of Swords signifies endings, and cutting one’s connections. Sometimes, this card can also suggest that you may be dealing with office politics that have left you defeated; perhaps colleagues have been spreading gossip. Alternatively, you may instead have been working very hard, pushing yourself to collapse, and forced to take a rest. All of this may have been necessary for you to grow; when you go forward and heal from this ordeal, think of what you have learned, and know that you will survive.",
    "finances_meaning": "Your financial situation may be grim. You may have put your money into something that has not yielded fruit, and you may be dealing with losses right now. Ensure that you cut all expenses related to this failing endeavor, and instead be cautious about your resources. Avoiding risk can be beneficial for you now.",
    "as_feelings": "The Ten of Swords signals a powerful confrontation with feelings of betrayal and deep disappointment. This person feels overwhelmed by past wounds, leaving them hurt and vulnerable. They may see your relationship as a source of pain rather than comfort, prompting them to question their emotional investment in you.\nYour own emotions mirror this intensity; the Ten of Swords embodies profound loss or defeat. You might feel like everything has crumbled around you, pushing you to your breaking point. Acknowledge these feelings: this moment can spark transformation and healing if you're ready to let go and embrace new beginnings.",
    "as_actions": "In the presence of the upright Ten of Swords, it’s time to embrace endings and release what no longer serves you. This card encourages you to confront painful truths, allowing for a fresh start. Acknowledge any feelings of betrayal or loss, but don’t dwell on them; instead, use this moment as a catalyst for transformation. Consider decluttering your space or ending toxic relationships that weigh you down. Engage in journaling to process your emotions and gain clarity on your next steps. By accepting these necessary closures, you create room for new opportunities and growth in your life moving forward.",

In other cases, the relationship may have already collapsed, but you have managed to cope.

    "as_actions": "As the Ten of Swords reveals itself, it’s time to let go of past pain and embrace healing. You should focus on releasing old wounds and negative thought patterns that have held you back. This may involve journaling your feelings, seeking therapy, or engaging in mindfulness practices like meditation to foster self-compassion. Additionally, consider surrounding yourself with supportive individuals who uplift you rather than drain your energy. Embrace new perspectives by exploring hobbies or interests that inspire joy and creativity, allowing yourself to envision a brighter future free from the burdens of the past."

  "abyss": "For those who read numerologically, I've again provided an alternative version of the Ten of Swords. This variation considers the Ten of Swords and its association with the Decad. Therefore, it represents the realization and completion of mental progression, going full circle. However, in this case, it is viewed in a positive manner—as an increase in mental power and knowledge as opposed to a loss of mental power and depletion. It's all about mastering the element of swords, air and mind, and learning from all that you've experienced. There is a reason why we look up to our elders for wisdom and guidance. They have seen more moons and suns, and if they have walked wisely, they are further along on the path of life. The owl is an ancient symbol of wisdom. It locks stares with the old sage, the years clearly etched within his features, for they are the many paths his soul has taken, and represent the footprints of time. The man is a figure full of thoughtfulness and intelligence and he meets the gaze of his totem equal in spirit and wisdom."
