  "description": "Here, we see Death riding a beautiful white horse while holding up a black flag with a white pattern. It is portrayed as a living skeleton, the bones being the only part of the human body existing after death. He wears armor, which gives him his invincibility - signaling that no one can destroy Death. The white horse that he rides stands for purity, as Death purifies everyone. Beneath him, all classes of humans lie in the dirt - a king, and a pauper, meant to remind us that death does not differentiate between class, race, gender.",

    "overview": "Death is one of the most feared cards in a Tarot Deck, and it is very misunderstood. Many people avoid mentioning this card because it has that much power. Most times, people take the name of the card literally. However, the real meaning within the Death card is one of the most positive in the whole deck.\nThe Death card signals that one major phase in your life is ending, and a new one is going to start. You just need to close one door, so the new one will open. The past needs to be placed behind you, so you can focus your energy on what is ahead of you.\n\nThe Death card signals that one major phase in your life is ending, and a new one is going to start.\n\nAnother meaning is that you are going to go through a major change, transition, or transformation. The old version of you needs to ‘die’ to allow the new you to be created. This can be a scary time for you because you may be unsure of what will happen in the future. Even if you are scared, you should welcome the change because you are opening the door to new life events.\nDeath can also mean that you need to let go of any unhealthy attachments that you have in your life. This is an important part of life, so learning to keep moving forward is one of the lessons Death teaches us.",
    "love_meaning": null,
    "career_meaning": "If you’ve been considering a career change, the upright Death card can be a signal that you should take the plunge and act now. You may have been through a period of apathy, disinterest and frustration at your current job, and should you not take decisive action, events in life may force you to make a change. You may be clinging to your current path because it offers stability, certainty and safety, but if you are otherwise unhappy or feeling unchallenged, there is much more to lose than your comfort. Often when one door closes, another one opens; embrace the shifts occurring right now and dive in.",
    "finances_meaning": "Loss is signaled by the Death tarot card, meaning that you may unfortunately be dealing with a loss in your financial resources. This period can also be the initiator to a transformation in how you handle your relationship to your money and what you value. The lessons you learn from this time can lead to practical changes when it comes to managing your resources, as well as to spiritual changes in knowing what is truly important to you.",
    "as_feelings": "The upright Death card signals a powerful moment of transformation and renewal. This person senses that your connection is evolving; they feel the end of old patterns and are open to new possibilities with you. Their emotions run deep as they recognize the need for change and growth within themselves, which can strengthen your bond if nurtured.\nYour own feelings mirror this shift. The upright Death card reveals that you, too, are experiencing significant personal changes. You may be ready to shed past baggage or emotional ties that no longer serve you. Embrace this transformative energy; it urges you to let go of what holds you back and welcome fresh beginnings in both love and life.",
    "as_actions": "When you draw the upright Death card, you’re being asked to embrace transformation and release what no longer serves you. This is a powerful moment for letting go of old habits, relationships, or mindsets that hinder your growth. Consider decluttering your space as a physical manifestation of this change; donate items that hold emotional weight but no longer resonate with who you are becoming. Additionally, reflect on areas in your life where fear may be holding you back. Perhaps it’s time to confront those fears head-on. Engage in new experiences that challenge your comfort zone, allowing yourself to evolve into the person you're meant to be.",
    "love": "changes in relationship, changes in romantic life, ending relationship",
    "career": "job transition, career transition, leaving unfulfilling career",
    "finances": "financial loss, adapting to financial loss, changing views of money"
  },
  "reversed": {
    "overview": "The Death reversal meaning is still about change, but that you have been resisting it. You could be worried about letting go of the past, or you could not be sure of the changes that you need to make to go forward. Resisting the change and holding onto the past can limit your future, which can cause you to feel like you are in limbo. You should take some time to assess the ways that you have been approaching changes in your life. You may find you have been halting the changes that you need due to fears of the unknown. While you can still be afraid, you should trust that you are taking the right steps and move forward. Life moves on, so fighting passing time is only going to leave you with regrets. Death does not have to be a card of regret, especially if you heed its warning.",
    "love_meaning": null,
    "career_meaning": "As with this card’s upright version, you are being pushed to a change when it comes to your job or your career path. But in reverse, you may be doing all you can to resist this transition. You may stick around despite the unhealthy environment, the reduced pay, or the monotonous projects. Change is inevitable; this applies to our career as well as other aspects of our lives. We must learn to welcome it instead of pushing it away. When we cling to a cycle that is no longer meant to remain in our lives, we watch it slowly decay and drain us. At times, this card can also represent negative patterns repeating once again in your workplace. Do you self-sabotage? Does your defensiveness when making mistakes create trouble? Does your impostor syndrome affect how you interact with your colleagues? Consider what must be let go for you to release these unhealthy patterns.",
    "finances_meaning": "A loss of financial resources may be unavoidable, but this may be hard for you to accept and adapt to. You may have to make some shifts when it comes to your expenses in order to make it through this temporary period, but you may find it hard to give up some things that you consider needs. Instead of allowing this time to change how you relate to your resources and what your values are, you may not be learning your lessons. Learn to stop resisting these changes, and you may have a much easier time coping.",
    "as_feelings": "When you draw the reversed Death card in a reading about how someone feels about you, it suggests that this person is grappling with resistance to change and transformation. They may feel stuck or hesitant, struggling to let go of past experiences that influence their perception of you. This could indicate lingering doubts or fears that prevent them from fully embracing their feelings for you, leaving them in a state of confusion.\nWith regard to your own emotions, the reversed Death card reflects an internal struggle as well. You might be feeling apprehensive about moving forward or letting go of old patterns that no longer serve you. There’s a sense of stagnation where growth seems daunting, yet deep down, there’s a yearning for renewal and clarity. Embrace this moment as an opportunity to confront what holds you back and consider how releasing these attachments can lead to personal evolution and deeper connections with others.",
    "as_actions": "When you draw the reversed Death card, it signals a struggle against necessary change or transformation. It’s time to embrace what needs to end in your life, whether it’s an unfulfilling job, a toxic relationship, or outdated beliefs. Acknowledge these areas and take actionable steps toward letting go. Start by journaling about what no longer serves you and create a plan for moving forward. Seek out new experiences that challenge your comfort zone; this could mean taking up a new hobby or meeting different people who inspire growth. Embrace the idea that endings can lead to fresh beginnings, allowing yourself to evolve into who you truly want to be.",
    "love": "resisting change in relationship, failure to change negative emotional patterns",
    "career": "repeating negative patterns at work, remaining at unfulfilling job, lack of growth",
    "finances": "failure to adapt to financial loss, continuing unhealthy financial habits"

  "abyss": "She has walked the earth since the beginning of time. Her expression is pensive and solemn as she strolls up and down the annals of the earth. A tireless presence, unseen yet felt by all. She is Death, the bringer of change and transformation. She waits within the liminal state, and hears the call of transmutation. Her roots dig deep into creation itself, her core is the endless night sky, where stars collapse and are reborn in an endless cycle that she calls home. She is the door that opens when all else closes. When the Death card makes its presence known in your spread, it rarely indicates the literal death of a loved one. This Major Arcana card is powerful indeed, typically depicting life-altering changes. It represents a very important ending in your life, but also the beginning of a new period. It is metamorphic in its message. Through this process of change you will need to shed those things that are no longer necessary, in order to make room for new possibilities. It is sometimes said that the Death card does not signify an ending, but rather a transition. It bears much in common with actual death, bringing fear of the unknown, the stripping down of the old, the preparation of a way for the new. Death comes to all; none of us is immune to it. Often it can come suddenly, without warning. That is something we should remember when this card appears in your reading. It most certainly is not a card that takes its time. Death, or rather transformation is an active process; there is nothing static about it. In these situations, it is wise not to get too attached to things that are no longer suited for you. Very often, they will be washed away in the process of change."
