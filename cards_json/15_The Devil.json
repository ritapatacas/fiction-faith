  "description": "This card shows the Devil represented in his most well-known satyr form, otherwise known as Baphomet. Along with being half goat and half man, the devil has bat wings and an inverted pentagram on his forehead. He is standing on a pedestal, to which are chained a nude man and woman, as if to show that he has dominion over them.\nBoth the man and the woman have horns, as if to show that the more time they spend with the Devil, the less human they become. The chains make it appear as though the devil has taken them captive. The man has a flame on his tail while a woman has a bowl of grapes on her tail, which symbolizes their addiction to power and finer things in life, respectively.\nLooking closely, both the man and the woman don’t look happy. Their individual power has been taken from them, leaving them exposed and ashamed in their nakedness.",

    "overview": "Getting the devil card in your reading shows that you have feelings of entrapment, emptiness and lack of fulfillment in your life. It might also mean that you are a slave to materialism and opulence and no matter how hard you try, you just can’t seem to shake off the feeling of wanting to indulge in luxurious living.\nYou might be aware that this kind of lifestyle is leading you down the rabbit hole, but you have that feeling of not having any form of control over your actions or urges.\n\nAddiction to substances or material pleasures can also be the reason for your feelings of powerlessness and entrapment.\n\nAddiction to substances or material pleasures can also be the reason for your feelings of powerlessness and entrapment. In situations such as these, you may feel as though you are a slave, unable to control your impulses or willpower to direct yourself towards something other than the satisfaction of these desires.",
    "love_meaning": "Lust and temptation are symbolized by the Devil in a love tarot reading. There can be a sense of hedonism, and a selfish desire for gratification with this card. In less serious circumstances, it can also just simply mean a pursuit for all of life’s earthly pleasures. There is nothing wrong in having a bit of fun, but make sure that you are not hurting others or giving them wrong impressions when you do. If you’re only looking for hook-ups, it is up to you to communicate that with your dates. Make sure you avoid pressuring others if they decide your lifestyle isn’t something that suits them. Communication will be more important than ever now.\nAlternatively, the Devil tarot love meaning can also signal addiction, and in the context of love and relationships, co-dependency. Over time, this can be destructive to the individuality and self of both partners. Be wary, and ensure that the two of you remain strong individuals within your relationship.",
    "career_meaning": "You may feel stuck or trapped when it comes to your career right now, like you don’t have any options but to stay somewhere that you dislike.

You may feel dependent on this job, without the power to make the changes that would bring you happiness. At times, this card can also signal self-sabotage and playing the victim when it comes to work relations with your colleagues. Regardless of what it feels like, the Devil’s appearance can signal that you have more choices than you think you do, you only need to reclaim your power. This can be scary, to take accountability for a situation that you dislike, but it can also be empowering.",
    "finances_meaning": "Difficult financial situations may be exaggerated with bad habits with the Devil in the reading. This can signal that there is often more that you can do to bring yourself out of this state, but you may be either failing to see the solutions, or you are unable to change the way that you handle your finances. You may be spending compulsively, gambling, or unable to take control of your material resources. Make sure you are doing all that you can.",
    "as_feelings": "The arrival of The Devil reveals a captivating yet tumultuous emotional landscape regarding someone's feelings for you. This person is intensely drawn to you, their attraction bordering on possessiveness. They are captivated by your energy but also wrestle with insecurities and unhealthy attachments. Their emotions run deep, teetering between desire and dependency.\nOn your end, The Devil suggests you're grappling with temptation or feeling trapped in certain patterns. You might feel pulled toward indulgence or distraction instead of confronting deeper issues within yourself. It's crucial to acknowledge these feelings and assess whether they uplift you or keep you stuck in unproductive cycles.",
    "as_actions": "In the presence of The Devil, you are called to confront the chains that bind you. This card urges you to recognize any unhealthy habits or toxic relationships in your life and take decisive action to break free from them. It’s time to embrace personal responsibility and acknowledge where you've given away your power.

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "The upside down meaning of the Devil card can be the moment when an individual becomes self-aware and breaks all of the chains that come with addiction and poor habits. It might be because they are tired of running in circles and are in need of change.\nBut one thing is usually clear – breaking off these chains, especially those of addiction is never easy. So, one has to be prepared to make the necessary changes that might initially seem painful to make the adjustments that will pay off in the end by being able to find your true self again.\nSelf-assessment is called for in this case and the individual needs to take some time and list all of the things that they need to get rid of. And once that has been done, and then it would be time for them to embark on the difficult journey of self-improvement.",
    "love_meaning": "The reversed Devil tarot love meaning can signal that you may be breaking free from some negative emotional patterns or addictions that have stood in the way of you developing strong relationships. You may feel more in control of your love life than ever. This card in some circumstances can also signal breaking away from a relationship with a domineering partner, or a co-dependent relationship that was not allowing you to express your true self. You may have recognized that the bonds that tied you to your partner were ones that were not healthy or supportive. Continue to nurture your own independence and be proud of what you have done.",
    "career_meaning": "When it comes to work, you are in the process of reclaiming your accountability in your career choices, and are in the process of making some much needed changes to avoid future issues. If you’ve been in a position that you’ve found stifling, you may be taking action; whether that means leaving an unfulfilling job, or an unhealthy environment, or choosing to fix a strained relationship with a colleague.

    "finances_meaning": "If you’ve had a history of bad financial habits, you may be working on making the changes necessary for you to retake control.

  "abyss": "The winged man hovers over an endless wasteland, shackled to the machinations of his own heart. He is an image of despair in the midst of absolute isolation. His wings are spread wide open, ready to take flight, yet he is unable to do so. Perhaps all that is needed is the will to remove himself from the lashings of his own design. No one holds back his wings, no one roots him in his cares; it is through his own attachments that he is confined. The Devil card speaks of our internal vices, those parts of ourselves that we keep hidden. It is reflective of the indulgences, addictions, and excesses that we permit into our lives. These are weaknesses that make us vulnerable and perpetually keep old wounds open. This tends to happen if we've strayed too far from our spiritual side and focused more on the materialistic aspects of life. Have you overindulged in the fruits of the world, eschewing those of the soul? This is something that only you can answer through reflection and introspection. You see, the Devil is not an external perpetrator; it is the shadow of our own selves. Look deeply within and be truthful. If this card should appear in your spread, is there anything in your life that is making you feel trapped or bound? What is making you feel powerless and out of control? Remember that the Devil card is not about subjugation without end. It is a card that calls you to be active in achieving your freedom; to take action and free yourself from burdensome attachments. You only need to choose to do so."
