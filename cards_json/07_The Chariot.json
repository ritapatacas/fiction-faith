  "description": "The Chariot tarot card depicts a figure sitting inside a vehicle that is being driven by two black and white sphinxes. The whole card has a bit of a celestial influence; the figure sits underneath a blue canopy adorned by white stars. On his shoulders, he carries the sign of the crescent moon, representing the spiritual influence under which he is guided. On his head sits a crown, meaning that he is enlightened, and that his will is pure. Emblazoned on his chest is a square, denoting the element of earth, of the material world, which grounds him and his actions.\n\nThe sphinxes are colored in black and white, a symbol of opposing forces that the charioteer must learn to control. Here they are calm, but they frequently get into scuffles as they seem to want to move in different directions. His task is to guide these sphinxes towards a destination, one that is marked by the cosmic forces that he represents.\n\nThe Chariot is linked to the Cancer zodiac sign.",

    "overview": "The reversed Chariot's appearance in a reading can help you become aware of both your aggression, and your lack of willpower.

Ultimately, this card brings up questions about how forceful or aggressive you are when pursuing your goals. Are you someone that waits around passively for things you want to happen, hoping that they’ll fall in your lap? Or are you so forceful, that you are inconsiderate of others in your pursuit of success? Both approaches can bring you trouble. Being aggressive to the point of hostility can backfire on you, while being so passive can never bring you the kind of happiness you desire. Are you okay with either of these options? What does a healthy middle ground look like?",
