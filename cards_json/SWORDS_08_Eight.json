  "description": "On the Eight of Swords is a woman who is tied up and blindfolded. There are eight swords placed strategically around her in a way that restricts her movement as though she is in some kind of trap or jail. However, it seems as though whoever built the trap was a little lazy or hasty, leaving some open space where she could escape. But because of the blindfold preventing the woman from seeing, she has no way of finding her way out of this trap. The barren land around her might signify a lack of creativity of some sort, while the grey sky in the background can signify despair, since there she feels that there is no hope of her breaking free from the kind of situation that she is bound to. If only she could take the blindfold off, she would see that she could simply just walk out of this situation.",
  "upright": {
    "overview": "The general meaning in the Eight of Swords is that of a feeling of being trapped and victimized. You may feel powerless because, in your mind, you feel that changing the situation might be beyond you. This feeling of helplessness that you have, the feeling that you have no agency in your life, has played a major role in making your situation worse.\n\nSurrendering one’s power to an unknown entity, whether it's fate, or God, the government or something else means that you are giving away your own personal responsibility to affect change.\n\nSurrendering one’s power to an unknown entity, whether it's fate, or God, the government or something else means that you are giving away your own personal responsibility to affect change. You have willingly relinquished the driver's seat in the journey of your own life, and it isn't going well for you. It is advisable for you to avoid making an important decision at this time since your judgment is likely clouded.\n\nThe good news is that because these traps are things that we create ourselves, we can also leave them if we put our minds to it. It is simply the matter of taking off the blindfold, and seeing beyond the limited perspective that we created for ourselves - to see the possibilities, and to recognize that you have your own internal power.",
    "love_meaning": "When the 8 of Swords appears in a love tarot reading, you may be feeling trapped; do you feel smothered in a relationship, or in a now stale partnership you cannot leave? You may feel as though you have no choices, but this usually isn’t the case if you look at the bigger picture. We deny ourselves possibilities when we are too scared of doing the hard work of communicating our boundaries or standing up for ourselves. In order to make changes, you must be the one to take action and control. Freedom doesn’t come with passivity. If you’re single, this card can also point to being too passive in your love life. You may be unwilling to venture and meet others, hoping that the solution to your romantic life will be a person that can sweep you off your feet. This often doesn’t yield results.",
    "career_meaning": "Your career isn’t quite what you thought it would be. Yet because your job is tied to your means of living, you feel that you can’t leave right now. You may feel you do not have a back up plan, or other positions, jobs or career paths available to you right now. If you’re looking to switch career paths, it may take some education, but this can be difficult without having a steady income. While it may feel like you don’t have options, you may just need to think outside the box. Anxiety may make you feel like you have less options than you actually do. Ask for help, look over your budget, turn a hobby into a business, find a reputable place to get a student loan; there are likely many options, where you don’t have to keep suffering.",
    "finances_meaning": "You may feel like things are closing in on you right now when it comes to your financial situation. Anxiety about the state of your bank account can alter how you perceive the reality of the situation. If you’re looking to make more cash, you may have more tools to do so than you think. Do you have a talent that someone else would pay for? Are you a talented writer? Ask if local businesses need a writer for their blog. Read tarot cards? Start charging for readings at your local cafe. There are so many ways to better your situation, you’ll just need to be a little more creative.",
    "as_feelings": "The upright Eight of Swords reveals a deep sense of entrapment and confusion. They feel restricted by their own thoughts or circumstances, leaving them uncertain about their emotions toward you. This card highlights their struggle with self-imposed limitations that hinder genuine expression of feelings. Fear and insecurity cloud their perception, making it hard to recognize the potential between you.\nFor your part, the Eight of Swords suggests you're also feeling trapped in your thoughts, questioning your worth and the viability of this connection. Acknowledge these mental barriers and seek clarity; only then can both of you break free from confusion and embrace what lies ahead.",
    "as_actions": "In terms of your current situation, the upright Eight of Swords suggests that you may be feeling trapped by your circumstances or thoughts. Now is the time to shift your perspective and recognize that many limitations are self-imposed. Begin by identifying negative beliefs that hold you back; write them down and challenge their validity. Take small, actionable steps toward freedom; perhaps enroll in a class to learn something new or reach out for support from friends or mentors who can offer guidance. Embrace vulnerability by sharing your feelings with someone you trust, as this can help dissolve the mental barriers keeping you confined.",
    "love": "feeling trapped, suffocated, smothered, passive in love life",
    "career": "dependence on job, can’t change careers, fear of job changes",
    "finances": "anxiety about money, can’t see financial opportunity"

  "reversed": {
    "overview": "As you take off the blindfold, take a long clear look at your romantic life. The 8 of Swords tarot love meaning can suggest that your perspective is changing now that you have a more clear and objective understanding of your relationship. Anxieties may be lifted, and it can now be clear to you what needs to be done in order to feel happier in your romantic life. If you’re single, you may find yourself more willing to take your love life into your own hands. Fears and anxieties that have blocked you from truly pursuing romance can be lifted.",

    "career_meaning": "It may have taken a while, but you have finally found release from your anxiety about your career. Things can be a bit easier now, and your vision is less clouded from stress or fear. Sometimes, this card can suggest a new job or position that you have attained, one that allows you to realize your full potential. The reversed 8 of Swords however, can at times also signify just the opposite. You may instead have lost all hope, resigned yourself to the idea that no matter what you do, this is the only path for you. Every day may be a struggle. Remember that you do have the power to change things, so long as you open your eyes to all possibilities, and don’t let fear take over. Nobody will save you except yourself.",
    "finances_meaning": "The reversed 8 of Swords can signal that your anxieties about money have either lessened, or intensified. You may finally be learning to see all the possibilities that are available to you, or alternatively, your fears and anxieties have just continued to get worse. You will need to address these fears before they continue to do damage to your mental health.",
    "as_feelings": "In the presence of the reversed Eight of Swords, it reveals a sense of liberation and newfound clarity. This person is beginning to break free from their own mental constraints, allowing them to see your relationship in a more positive light. They may have previously felt trapped or confused, but now they are recognizing the potential for growth and connection between you two.\nWhen you draw this card, it suggests that you are also experiencing a shift. You might be moving away from self-imposed limitations and embracing empowerment. As you release fears and doubts, you're opening yourself up to new possibilities within this relationship, feeling more confident in expressing your true emotions without being held back by past insecurities.",
    "as_actions": "As the Eight of Swords reveals itself, it’s time to break free from self-imposed limitations and take decisive action. You may be feeling trapped by your thoughts or circumstances, but this card encourages you to shift your perspective. Start by identifying one fear that holds you back and confront it head-on; whether it's applying for a new job or having an honest conversation with someone important in your life, taking that first step is crucial. Additionally, consider journaling to clarify your thoughts and feelings, allowing yourself the freedom to explore new possibilities without judgment. Embrace change as a path toward empowerment."

  "abyss": "The Eight of Swords deals with the idea of perception and perspective. I chose to illustrate this card as if you're looking from above, because seeing an objective point of view is particularly important with this card. We see a young girl wrapped in ribbons, so much so that she can only see out of one eye, where the ribbon has fallen away. The only part of her that is without constraint is her wild, flowing hair. Or at least this is how it appears at first glance. A closer look at her situation reveals she's not as tightly bound as she might feel. The swords that at first appear to fence her in are in fact lying flat on the floor around her. To extricate herself, all she needs to do is step around them. The Eight of Swords speaks to the idea of feeling trapped and powerless. It can show up when we feel lost, alone, and with no way out of a situation, whether it's a dead-end job or a loveless relationship. Regardless of the situation, one fact remains the same. You have become conditioned and complacent, so much so that you are no longer seeing things objectively. Acting the victim won't get you out of it, nor is waiting for someone to rescue you a good course. Scan your surroundings for an exit point. You may very well realize that all you have to do is remove your blindfold and choose to step out of the situation."
