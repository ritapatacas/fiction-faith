    "overview": "To draw the Seven of Cups in a reading shows that you need to clearly see the shadows and visions in your imagination, not only in your dreams but also in the real world. You should be careful of wishful thinking and be alert of the choices that you make. In one sense, the Seven of Cups indicates that you are a dreamer who is both excited and afraid of the things that you see in your unconscious. In another, the Seven of Cups is a reminder that although it is good to have dreams and wishes, it is even better to take action attaining those dreams. At one point in life, you will need to stop fantasizing and face the reality of life.\nIf you are unable to make a decision due to the many options that are available, you should evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each option so as to make the best choice. It is important to exercise caution when you are making your decision, as the card itself seems to show there is not only wonders and treasures that are available to you, but also monsters and shadows.\n\nThere are some cases when the Seven of Cups may show that you are living in ways that are not necessarily grounded in real life - that your actions are guided by illusions that you feed yourself. Your ideas may be so up in the clouds, developed only on your imagination. As such, you will need to separate what is real and what is not so that you can make better choices.\n\nYou will need to separate what is real and what is not so that you can make better choices.\n\nThe Seven of Cups is also linked with temptation.

  "abyss": "The woman in the card floats above the earth with her head literally in the clouds, her thoughts swirling about as so many images. The Seven of Cups is a card I've always associated with wishful thinking and fantasy. There is a gullibility that comes with the Seven of Cups; we tend to think we have all these imaginary options that aren't necessarily true. In order to be able to see clearly, we need to bring our feet back down to earth. The Seven of Cups is the card of fanciful and ungrounded thinking. It shows up in a spread when we may be letting our imagination run wild and disregarding key facts. We can certainly do that, for a time. Avoiding the truth sometimes can protect us to a degree. However, eventually we have to come back to reality. This is the time to be honest with yourself and examine your situation objectively. If serious decisions need to be made, now is not a good time to make them."
